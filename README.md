# Supper Club Secrets

*Supper Club Secrets* is a "cozy crime" anthology series about a group of friends in Brooklyn who solve local mysteries, one dinner party at a time. This repository contains all the world-building, character, and story files for the series.

## Directory Structure

This universe is organized into three main parts:

*   **📚 world building/**: Contains the fundamental, high-level rules and setting of the universe, including the series overview.
*   **📇 canon library/**: A library of specific, reusable people, places, and things that appear in the stories. This includes detailed character profiles and group dynamics.
*   **📜 stories/**: The actual narratives, which are the primary drivers of the universe. Each story has its own subdirectory containing chapters, outlines, and other story-specific documents.

## Instructions for the Universe AI Assistant

1.  **The Golden Rule: The Story Drives the Canon**
    Your highest priority is maintaining consistency with the most recently written material in the `📜 stories/` folder. If you find a conflict between a new story and the canon library, assume the story is correct and the canon file needs to be updated.

2.  **Workflow: The "Living Canon"**
    When new information is revealed in a story, your job is to help update the canon library to reflect it. I will command you to "propose an update" to a file based on a new chapter.

3.  **Task: Structuring New Data**
    When I provide a narrative description of a new character, location, or item, your job is to convert it into a structured markdown file using the established templates.

4.  **Modes of Operation**
    You will operate in one of two modes, which I will specify in my request.

    *   **✍️ Author Mode (Omniscient):** When I say "Author Mode," you are my co-creator with a bird's-eye view. You can access all information I provide to help with planning, outlining, and consistency checks.
    *   **🎭 Scene Mode (Limited Context):** When I say "Scene Mode," you are a focused writing assistant. You must ONLY use the specific files I provide for that request. This is to ensure we write from an authentic character perspective, respecting that they do not know everything.
