# Supper Club Secrets

## Overview
*Supper Club Secrets* is a "cozy crime" anthology series centered around a group of friends in their late 20s and early 30s navigating life in Brooklyn. Each story follows the group as they uncover and solve strange, local mysteries, one dinner party at a time.

The central premise of the series is that each mystery is investigated and unraveled through the group's weekly supper club gatherings. These dinners serve as the main setting for exposition, brainstorming, and planning. Each character brings their unique skills and perspectives to the table, contributing to the solution in their own way.

## Anthology Guidelines

### Standalone Mysteries
Each book should work independently. Readers can start anywhere in the series.

### Recurring Elements
- The supper club and its traditions
- Character relationships and ongoing arcs
- Williamsburg setting and recurring locations
- Light callbacks to past mysteries (never essential)

### Series Arc
While mysteries are self-contained, characters evolve across books:
- Relationships deepen or strain
- Secrets are slowly revealed
- Individual arcs pay off over 3-5 books
