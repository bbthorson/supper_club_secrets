## The Scene

The table was cluttered with empty plates and half-filled wine glasses. Emma had stopped trying to clear them; the conversation had taken on a life of its own.

"Okay but hear me out—" Jasper was already standing, gesturing with his wine glass in a way that made Oliver lean away slightly. "What if it's not just about hot sauce? What if Hank stumbled onto something *big*. Like, cartel-level big. Pepper cartels. Capsaicin kingpins. And now he's in—"

"Witness protection," Noah cut in, annoyed. "I was literally about to say witness protection."

"I was going to say *hiding in a bunker*," Jasper said, pointing at Noah. "Much more dramatic. Much more likely."

"Neither of those is likely." Oliver didn't look up from his phone. "In 2018, a chili pepper farm in New Mexico was raided for trafficking, but it was the only documented case of—"

"Babe, they don't need the full Wikipedia article," Olivia said, squeezing his arm. She turned to the group with that perfect calibration of concern and intrigue. "But speaking of farms—I talked to Maria at the flower shop. She said—" Olivia paused, took a sip of wine, let the silence build. "She said she saw Hank get into a very nice car. *Not* his car. Black. Tinted windows. Just... climbed right in."

"That's actually interesting," Emma said from the kitchen doorway. She'd been pretending to wash dishes while listening.

"It's probably nothing," Noah said. "An Uber Black. He was going somewhere nice."

"At 6 AM? On a Sunday?" Olivia raised an eyebrow. "In *Williamsburg*?"

"Maybe he has a breakfast meeting."

"Sure. A breakfast meeting in a car that Maria described as looking 'government-adjacent.'"

Jasper pointed at Olivia triumphantly. "*Government-adjacent!* That's what I'm saying! CIA. FDA. Big Hot Sauce is—"

"There's no such thing as Big Hot Sauce," Elijah said, not looking up from his phone. He'd been scrolling through something for the last ten minutes.

"That's exactly what someone on Big Hot Sauce's payroll would say," Jasper shot back.

Elijah's mouth twitched—almost a smile. "So we're investigating now. Because that's what happens when we drink wine."

"We're *speculating*," Emma corrected, coming back to the table. "There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Speculating is fun. Investigating sounds like work." Emma topped off her wine glass. "And I don't have the bandwidth for work right now."

The table went quiet for a moment. Everyone knew Emma's situation—the freelance gigs, the money stress, the vague "building her brand" plan that seemed to be more wish than strategy.

"Then let's keep it fun," Olivia said brightly, steering them away from the silence. "What's your theory, Emma? You knew Hank best."

Emma hesitated. She hadn't actually wanted to play this game, but now everyone was looking at her.

"I mean... the boring answer is Big Hot Sauce. Capital-B Big." She used finger quotes. "Some corporation bought out his recipe. Happens all the time in the food industry. They make you an offer, you take it because the money's good, and suddenly you're not a vendor anymore. You're just... gone."

"That's not boring," Noah said. "That's acquisitions. That's how business works."

"It's sad, though," Olivia said.

"It's practical," Elijah said. "If someone offered to buy my entire future right now, I'd at least hear them out."

Oliver finally looked up from his phone. "I found something."

Everyone turned to him. He seemed startled by the attention.

"It's—I mean, it's probably nothing. But there's a new commercial permit filed for a restaurant concept called 'Hank's Heritage Hot Sauce Kitchen.' Filed three weeks ago. Under a different name."

"Different than Hank?" Emma asked.

"Different than anyone we've mentioned." Oliver showed them his phone, then immediately looked uncomfortable with being the center of attention. "It could be a coincidence. It's a common name."

"Heritage Hot Sauce Kitchen," Jasper repeated slowly. "That's either a charming farm-to-table concept or a *money laundering front*, and I know which one I'm betting on."

"You're betting on the insane option," Noah said. "Like always."

"And sometimes I'm *right*. Like always."

Elijah put down his phone. "Okay. I'm interested."

Emma looked around the table. An hour ago, this had been dinner. Now it was... something else.

"We're not actually doing this, right?" she said. "Like, *investigating*?"

"Think of it as aggressive speculation," Olivia said, grinning.

"With a side of light stalking," Jasper added.

"*Research*," Oliver corrected quietly.

Emma looked down at her wine. The responsible answer was no—she had enough problems. But the truth was, this was the most alive she'd felt in weeks. The kitchen didn't care if something was wrong with Hank. But here, at this table, with these people, there was something to solve.

"Fine," she said. "But I'm dessert next week. Someone else is on entrée."

## Voice Check

| Character | Register Used | Contradiction Surfaced? | Distinct Voice? |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Emma** | Private → touches on pressure (money mention) | ✓ Distance from risk-taking | ✓ Self-deprecating, food industry perspective |
| **Elijah** | Private (dry sarcasm) | — | ✓ Economical, punchline delivery |
| **Noah** | Private (jargon + annoyance) | — | ✓ Dismissive, systems-thinking |
| **Oliver** | Private → nervous when noticed | ✓ Prolific research vs. social discomfort | ✓ Quiet until prompted, then precise |
| **Olivia** | Public/hostess mode | — | ✓ Dramatic pauses, steering conversations |
| **Jasper** | Public chaos mode | — | ✓ Breathless, conspiratorial, physical |

**Assessment:** Voices are distinct. This scene is "light"—mostly public/private registers. A later scene (Meal 3 crisis) should test the "under pressure" registers.
