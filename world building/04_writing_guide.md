# Writing Guide: Crushable Cozy Crime

This guide defines the style, pacing, and structural rules for *Supper Club Secrets*—a series designed for adults 18-40 who want engaging mysteries they can finish in 2-3 sittings.

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Adults 18-40 who:
- Love character-driven fiction with low-stakes mysteries
- Want something "crushable" (satisfying, not exhausting)
- Might not identify as "cozy mystery" readers but enjoy *The Thursday Murder Club* vibes

**Reading context:** Commutes, beach vacations, before-bed wind-down, weekend afternoons.

---

## Book Structure

### Length Target
**45,000-50,000 words / ~180-200 pages**

This hits the sweet spot: long enough to feel satisfying, short enough to finish in 2-3 sittings.

### Story Architecture: Four Meals

Each book is structured around **four dinner gatherings**, which map to a modified Save the Cat beat sheet:

| Meal | Acts | Beats | Emotional Arc |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Meal 1** | Setup | Opening Image → Catalyst → Debate | Comfort → Curiosity |
| **Meal 2** | Fun & Games | Investigation montage → Midpoint | Discovery → Momentum |
| **Meal 3** | Crisis | Bad Guys Close In → All Is Lost → Dark Night | Setback → Doubt |
| **Meal 4** | Resolution | Break into 3 → Finale → Final Image | Action → Satisfaction |

### Chapter Targets

| Section | Chapters | Words/Chapter | Total Words |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Meal 1 | 4-5 | 2,000-2,500 | ~10,000 |
| Meal 2 | 5-6 | 2,000-3,000 | ~14,000 |
| Meal 3 | 4-5 | 2,000-2,500 | ~10,000 |
| Meal 4 | 4-5 | 2,500-3,000 | ~12,000 |
| **Total** | **17-21** | — | **~46,000** |

**Flexibility:** Some chapters will be short scene-bridges (800 words); others will be full meal scenes with multiple reveals (3,500 words). Length follows function.

## Tone Calibration

### The Cozy Crime Sweet Spot

| Element | Too Cozy | Sweet Spot | Too Thriller |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Stakes** | Mild inconvenience | Livelihood / reputation | Life or death |
| **Villain** | Misguided, lovable | Self-interested, not evil | Violent, dangerous |
| **Danger** | Embarrassment | Legal / financial harm | Physical harm |
| **Resolution** | Hugs all around | Justice + character growth | Villain destroyed |

### Tone Dial
Think of every scene on a dial from 1 (cozy) to 10 (thriller):

- **Most scenes:** 3-5 (warm banter, light investigation, character moments)
- **Midpoint / crisis peaks:** 6-7 (real consequences, genuine worry)
- **Never exceed 7** without very good reason

### Red Lines
- **No violence on-page.** Threats to livelihood, not life.
- **No gore.** If someone is hurt (rare), cut away.
- **Villain is human.** Greedy, not evil. The reader might understand their motives even while disagreeing.

## Mystery Complexity

### The Formula: Solvable but Not Obvious

Readers should reach the reveal thinking *"Oh, of course!"*—not *"Wait, where did that come from?"*

**Structure:**
- **One central mystery** (What happened to Hank?)
- **One B-plot** (Emma's financial vulnerability / secret OnlyFans)
- **2-3 red herrings** (each character pursues their conspiracy theory)
- **5 key clues max** that the reader *could* piece together

### Clue Planting

| Clue Type | When to Plant | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Foundation clue** | Meal 1 | Hank acting nervous, checking his phone |
| **Misdirection clue** | Meal 2 | False lead that each character chases |
| **Connective clue** | Meal 2 midpoint | Oliver's permit discovery connecting dots |
| **Confirmation clue** | Meal 3 | Evidence that narrows to the real answer |
| **Keystone clue** | Meal 4 | Final piece that locks the solution |

### Fair Play
The reader should have access to all information needed to solve the mystery by the end of Meal 3. No deus ex machina reveals in Meal 4.

---

## Pacing: Beat-Based, Not Word-Count Based

Don't count words—count **beats**. Each chapter should accomplish 1-2 beats:

| Beat Type | Purpose | Pacing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Character beat** | Reveal personality, deepen relationships | Slower, dialogue-heavy |
| **Clue beat** | Plant or reveal information | Medium, mix of action and reaction |
| **Escalation beat** | Raise stakes, increase tension | Faster, shorter paragraphs |
| **Meal beat** | Central gathering scene with multiple threads | Longer, ensemble dialogue |

### Scene Tempo Patterns

**Meal scenes:** Longer, ensemble-heavy, multiple beats woven together. These are set pieces.

**Between-meal scenes:** Shorter, often single-character POV, focused on one beat. These move plot.

**Crisis scenes (Meal 3):** Fastest tempo. Short sentences. More white space. Characters interrupted.

---

## Food as Emotional Anchor

Food should **mirror the group's emotional state**:

| Meal | Emotional State | Food Approach |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Meal 1** | Comfort, routine | Emma's planned menu, warm and seasonal |
| **Meal 2** | Excitement, discovery | Ambitious potluck, everyone showing off |
| **Meal 3** | Crisis, defeat | Seamless delivery—no one can cook |
| **Meal 4** | Celebration, resolution | Elevated potluck, Hank returns with hot sauce |

### Sensory Writing
Ground every meal scene in **at least two senses** beyond taste:
- Sound of sizzling, clinking glasses, overlapping voices
- Smell of caramelizing onions, wine breathing, autumn air
- Touch of warm bowls, cold wine glasses, stepping barefoot on kitchen tile

But don't overwri te—one vivid sensory detail beats three generic ones.

## Dialogue Principles

### Show the Voice, Don't Explain It
Bad: *"I think it's aliens," Jasper said enthusiastically, waving his hands like he always did.*  
Good: *"Okay but hear me out—" Jasper was already standing, wine sloshing. "What if it's not just hot sauce..."*

### Let Characters Interrupt
Real group conversations overlap. Use em-dashes for interruptions. Let faster talkers (Jasper, Olivia) cut off slower ones (Oliver, Elijah).

### Dialogue Tags: Less Is More
- Use "said" 80% of the time—it's invisible
- Character actions replace tags: *Elijah put down his phone. "So we're investigating now."*
- Reserve colorful tags ("muttered," "snapped") for genuine emphasis

### Distinctive Tics (Use Sparingly)
Each character has speech patterns (see Voice Guide), but don't hit them every line. Once per scene is enough for a reader to hear the character.

---

## POV & Perspective

### Emma as Primary POV
Story 1 is told primarily from Emma's perspective. She's the reader's entry point.

### Rotating POV (Optional, Later Books)
Future books can shift POV between characters for variety, but avoid head-hopping within scenes.

### What Emma Knows
Emma can observe, suspect, and speculate—but she can't read minds. Her observations should be filtered through her personality:
- She notices food and kitchen details others miss
- She misjudges confident people as having it together
- She's slower to catch tech-related observations than Noah would be

---

## Series Continuity

### Standalone Mysteries
Each book should work independently. The mystery starts and resolves within the book.

### Recurring Elements
- The supper club itself (rotating hosts after Book 1)
- Character arcs that develop across books
- Williamsburg setting and recurring locations
- References to past mysteries (but not required knowledge)

### Canon Library Updates
After completing each book, update the canon library with:
- New locations introduced
- New minor characters
- Any character development that changes profiles
- Clues to future books planted
