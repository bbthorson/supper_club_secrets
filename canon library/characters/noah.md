# Noah

## Overview
An idealistic and sometimes naive techie who believes technology can solve any problem.

## Personality
*   A strong believer in tech utopianism, convinced that technology and automation are the ultimate solutions.
*   His first instinct is to dismiss problems that don't have a clean, immediate digital solution.
*   Naive and easily swayed by new ideas, except when they come from Jasper.
*   Pedantically minimalist, obsessed with owning only one type and color of t-shirt.
*   When trying to persuade others, he tends to lead with technical jargon before resorting to oversimplified logic if he isn't being understood.

## Background

### Childhood & Family
Noah grew up in an affluent suburb outside Chicago—the kind of place with good schools, two-car garages, and parents who bought their kids computers early. His family wasn't wealthy-wealthy, but they were comfortable. Unlike Emma's and Elijah's families, the 1990s manufacturing decline didn't touch them.

His parents were both professionals—his father in IT consulting, his mother in healthcare administration. They were busy, distracted, and well-meaning. Noah was their tech support from age ten onward: setting up the router, fixing the printer, explaining why the computer was slow. He grew to love the predictable logic of computers. Defined inputs, defined outputs. Problems that could be *solved*.

Humans, he discovered early, were not as easy to debug.

### The Minimalist Philosophy
Noah's minimalism emerged in college, when he read a few too many productivity blogs and became convinced that owning less would make him more efficient. He standardized his wardrobe: identical black t-shirts, identical jeans. He kept his apartment sparse. He believed—and still believes—that decision fatigue is real and that simplifying external choices frees mental energy for what matters.

The philosophy is genuine. It's also armor. If you don't have things, you can't lose them.

### The Sneaker Collection
The sneakers started before the minimalism. In high school, Noah became fascinated with rare sneaker releases—the limited drops, the secondary market, the intersection of aesthetics and scarcity. He couldn't afford to collect seriously until his first real tech job, but he'd been tracking prices and releases for years.

Now he owns a carefully curated collection of rare and valuable sneakers, kept in pristine condition in their original boxes, hidden in the back of his closet. They're organized by release date. Some are worth thousands.

This is his hypocrisy. He preaches minimalism and owns multiple boxes of shoes he never wears. He tells himself they're an "investment," but the truth is he loves them. He loves the colors, the designs, the craftsmanship. He loves *having* them.

No one knows. Not even the group. If anyone opened that closet, he'd have to explain himself, and he's not sure he can.

### Tech Career & The Present
Noah works as a software engineer at a late-stage startup with an unclear business model—something about "logistics optimization" that he can explain in either thirty seconds or thirty minutes, depending on how much jargon he uses. He's good at his job, paid well, and mostly works from home.

He moved to Brooklyn four years ago, following a job opportunity. He met Oliver through a mutual friend who worked in a tangential industry—they bonded over systems thinking and a shared appreciation for efficient processes. Oliver invited him to dinner; Olivia insisted he keep coming.

Noah is the least connected to the neighborhood. He orders everything online. He rarely walks to local shops. The farmers market was irrelevant to him until Emma made it relevant. But he's learning that some problems—the good ones—can't be solved with code.

## Skills
*   Rapid online research and pattern recognition.
*   Technical problem-solving and data analysis.
*   Building quick digital tools—can whip up a script or burner account infrastructure.
*   Explaining complex tech in (increasingly oversimplified) analogies.

## Relationships
*   **Oliver:** Met him through work-adjacent circles. They share a love of systems and efficiency, though Noah finds Oliver's Luddite tendencies frustrating.
*   **Olivia:** Bonds with her over their shared optimism, though her constant social networking baffles him. He doesn't understand why she doesn't just optimize it.
*   **Jasper:** Playful rivalry. Noah hates Jasper's disregard for rules and structure. Jasper loves pushing Noah's buttons.
*   **Emma:** Often disagrees with her on the best approach to problems—he favors tech solutions, she favors traditional methods. Finds her "intuition" talk frustrating but respects her knowledge.
*   **Elijah:** Gets along due to their shared systematic thinking, though he thinks Elijah is too cautious.

## Character Arc
*   To learn that not all solutions can be found online, and that human connection and intuition are valid inputs—even when they're messy and inefficient.

## Secrets
*   The sneaker collection. It's worth more than his first car. He tells himself it's an investment, but really it's proof that he's not as logical as he pretends to be.
