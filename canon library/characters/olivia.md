## Overview

*   The most optimistic of the group, often seeing the best in people and situations.
*   Believes that mysteries often involve romantic or dream-chasing elements.

## Background

### Childhood & Family
Olivia grew up in the same general area as Elijah—the Philadelphia suburbs—though her family was more comfortable. Her parents owned a small catering business, which gave her an early education in networking, customer service, and the art of making people feel special.

She was always social. Class president material without the ambition to actually run. The girl who threw parties, organized fundraisers, and remembered everyone's birthday. People gravitated toward her naturally, and she learned early that being liked was its own kind of power.

### High School & Elijah
Olivia was two years behind Elijah in high school. She knew him as the serious, driven kid who studied in the library while she organized pep rallies. They didn't run in the same circles, but she remembered him—partially because he was one of the few people who didn't seem to need her approval, which intrigued her.

Years later, when she spotted him at a Brooklyn coffee shop, she didn't hesitate. She walked over, reminded him who she was (he remembered), and talked for forty-five minutes. By the end, he was coming to dinner that weekend. Olivia collects people; she collected him back.

### Meeting Oliver
Oliver happened freshman year of college. Olivia sat next to him in an introductory political science class because the seat was open. She asked to borrow a pen. She didn't stop talking to him after that.

She was fascinated by him—his quietness, his precision, the way he'd say one perfect thing after an hour of listening. He was so different from her, and she found herself wanting to understand how his mind worked. By sophomore year, she'd worn him down. By senior year, she couldn't imagine marrying anyone else.

They got married at 25, after nearly seven years together. A small wedding—his preference. She made it feel like a celebration anyway.

### The Serial Entrepreneur
Olivia has started more businesses than she can count. Candle-making. A neighborhood newsletter. Pop-up vintage sales. Cooking classes. Community event planning. A brief stint selling vintage jewelry on Etsy.

None of them have "failed" in the traditional sense. She usually exits gracefully, having made a small profit or at least broken even. The truth is, she has excellent instincts for the zeitgeist—she gets into trends before they peak and gets out before they crash. She's not interested in scaling; she's interested in *doing*.

Currently, she's between projects, which means she has more time than usual for gossip, dinner parties, and neighborhood mysteries.

### The Present
Olivia and Oliver live in a one-bedroom in Williamsburg. She decorated it; he keeps it organized. She maintains their social calendar, handles their relationships with neighbors and local businesses, and generates the energy that Oliver cannot produce on his own.

She knows he relies on her. This is mostly fine—she loves being needed. But sometimes, late at night, she wonders: does he love her, or does he need her? Are those the same thing? She's never asked. She's not sure she wants the answer.

She met Emma about four years ago at the McCarren Park farmers market. Emma was explaining heirloom tomatoes to a confused shopper, and Olivia jumped in to ask follow-up questions. By the end of the conversation, Olivia had decided they were going to be friends. Emma didn't stand a chance.

## Skills
*   Networking and information gathering—she knows everyone in the neighborhood.
*   Calibrating her reactions to draw people out (the "perfect calibration of concern and intrigue").
*   Sensing trends and zeitgeist shifts.
*   Making people feel comfortable and valued.

## Relationships
*   **Oliver:** Married to him. He's her anchor, her quiet center. She loves him deeply, but worries about the imbalance in their dynamic.
*   **Elijah:** Knew him in high school. Reconnected him with the group. Finds his sarcasm entertaining; sometimes wishes he'd relax.
*   **Emma:** Met her at the farmers market. Admires her talent and authenticity. Considers her a genuine friend, not just a collected one.
*   **Noah:** Bonds over shared optimism, though she doesn't understand his tech obsession. Wishes he'd go outside more.
*   **Jasper:** Finds him ridiculous but enjoys his chaos. Sometimes worries he's going to get them all in trouble.

## Character Arc
*   To learn when to stop collecting and start deepening—focusing her energy on meaningful investigation and genuine connection rather than surface-level networking.

## Secrets
*   Her anxiety about Oliver's dependence on her. She fears it's not love; it's need. She's never said this out loud to anyone.
