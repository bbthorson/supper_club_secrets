# Jasper

## Overview
The wildcard of the group, a free spirit with a mysterious job and a love for chaos.

## Personality
*   A free spirit who enjoys pushing boundaries and challenging expectations.
*   Loves to cause chaos and stir the pot, but genuinely cares about his friends and wants them to be happy.
*   Believes societal rules and norms are not truly enforced.
*   His conspiracy-mindedness is a form of play, not a genuine belief system. He's a provocateur, not a prophet.
*   A very physical storyteller, using gesticulations and connecting wildly unrelated things with breathless energy.

## Background

### Childhood & Family
Jasper comes from old money—not Rockefeller-level, but close enough. His great-great-grandfather made a fortune in [industry TBD—railroads? textiles? banking?], and while the family no longer uses that original surname, the money and the expectations remain.

Jasper grew up in a world of formal dinners, summer estates, boarding school applications, and the unspoken assumption that he would become Someone Respectable. His extended family is a gallery of lawyers, bankers, and politicians—people who wear their success like armor and discuss net worth over brunch.

He hated it. All of it. The stiffness, the propriety, the way everyone performed their roles like actors in a play no one enjoyed. He was the kid who asked uncomfortable questions at the dinner table, who "forgot" his tie, who once brought a friend from public school to a family event and watched the barely-concealed horror ripple through the room.

His chaos isn't random—it's rebellion. Against expectation. Against boring. Against becoming *them*.

### The Mysterious Job
Jasper works at the **NYC 311 Call Center**. It's the perfect anti-establishment gig for someone allergic to career ambition.

He answers calls about noise complaints, pothole reports, and confused tourists. He clocks in, clocks out, and collects a paycheck he doesn't need. His ancestors would be appalled.

But the job has an unexpected benefit: Jasper hears *everything*. Every complaint, every neighborhood dispute, every bizarre request gets logged in the system. He knows which blocks have ongoing feuds. He knows which landlords cut corners. He knows things that aren't technically public, but aren't exactly private either.

When he needs information, he knows who to call. Not through family connections—through the weird, sprawling network of city workers, regulars, and oddballs he's befriended over years of clock-punching.

### How He Joined the Group
Jasper's entry into the friend group is mythologized slightly differently depending on who tells it.

The truth: About two years ago, Oliver was dealing with a bureaucratic nightmare involving his apartment's lease renewal and a zoning technicality. Nothing dangerous, just infuriating. Jasper happened to overhear him complaining at a coffee shop—or maybe he was eavesdropping; the line is blurry with Jasper—and offered unsolicited help.

Within 48 hours, Jasper had made three phone calls, accessed records Oliver didn't know existed, and resolved the problem. He showed up to Oliver's apartment to deliver the good news, met Olivia, and was invited to dinner by way of thanks.

He came to dinner. And then another dinner. And then he was just... there. Part of the group. No one remembers formally inviting him. Jasper claims he's "collecting his fee in meals and entertainment."

### The Present
Jasper lives alone in a surprisingly nice apartment in Bushwick—paid for, at least partially, by a trust fund he doesn't talk about. He works his 311 shifts, attends the supper club, and maintains a rolodex of connections that makes no logical sense.

He's the chaos agent. The one who complicates investigations by oversharing, but also the one who breaks cases wide open with a single phone call. The group has learned to deploy him strategically: give Jasper a specific piece of information to act on, and he'll find someone who knows something.

He's never told anyone the real reason he lives the way he does: that becoming serious, becoming respectable, becoming *trapped* at that formal family dinner table is his deepest fear. The chaos is his shield.

## Skills
*   Unexpected connections and out-of-the-box thinking.
*   Accessing information through his 311 network and city worker contacts.
*   Reading people and social situations (despite pretending not to).
*   Connecting with people from diverse backgrounds—the only one in the group equally comfortable with trust fund kids and bodega owners.

## Relationships
*   **Elijah:** Respects his principles, even if he disagrees with them. Enjoys being the target of Elijah's sarcasm—treats it as part of their dynamic.
*   **Noah:** Loves to tease him. Their playful rivalry is one of his favorite entertainments.
*   **Emma:** Admires her grounded nature. Sometimes worries she works too hard.
*   **Oliver:** Helped him with a bureaucratic problem, which is how he joined the group. Finds his quietness amusing.
*   **Olivia:** Appreciates that she lets him be himself. Sometimes tries to prevent her from being overbearing with Oliver.

## Character Arc
*   To find his place in the group beyond being the chaos agent—learning when to be strategic, when to be quiet, and that discretion can be its own kind of freedom.

## Secrets
*   The old money background. He downplays it, redirects questions about his family, and actively cultivates the impression that his trust fund is smaller than it is. His chaotic persona is a rebellion against his deepest fear: being trapped by conventionality.
