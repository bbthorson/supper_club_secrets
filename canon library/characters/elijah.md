## Background

### Childhood & Family
Elijah grew up in a working-class neighborhood in the Philadelphia suburbs—the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where his grandmother lived in the back room of their house, and where success meant getting out.

His family is large and close. He has two younger siblings, and his extended family—aunts, uncles, cousins—lived within a few miles. Sunday dinners were expected, not optional. Family events were non-negotiable. This closeness was both a safety net and a weight; Elijah learned early that his success wasn't just for him.

His father worked as a supervisor at a distribution center; his mother was a nurse's aide. Both parents made it clear that education was Elijah's ticket to a different life. He was the first in his family to go to college.

### High School
Elijah attended a regional high school with a magnet program for academically advanced students. He was driven, focused, and quietly ambitious. He wasn't unpopular, but he wasn't part of any particular social group—too busy studying, working a part-time job, and keeping his GPA high enough for scholarships.

He knew Olivia in high school. She was two years behind him, effortlessly social, genuinely kind, and seemingly friends with everyone. They weren't close—she was the girl who smiled at everyone in the hallway; he was the guy who was always studying. But she remembered him, and years later, when they both ended up in Brooklyn, she simply collected him back into her life.

### UPenn & Early Career
Elijah got into the University of Pennsylvania on a combination of scholarships, financial aid, and loans. It was the first time he'd been surrounded by people who'd had private tutors, SAT coaches, and parents who could write checks for anything.

He adapted. He learned to code-switch—to dress like them, talk like them, navigate their world without losing himself. But he never forgot that he was there on borrowed money and borrowed time. While his classmates partied, he studied. While they took unpaid internships that their parents funded, he worked campus jobs.

He got into investment banking through sheer determination and performance. But once inside, he noticed that he wasn't advancing as fast as classmates who'd done the same work. Promotions went to people with the right connections, the right names, the right ease. The discrimination was rarely overt—it was in the assumptions, the overlooked emails, the "culture fit" conversations. He learned to document everything and trust no one professionally.

### The Present
Elijah now works at a mid-tier investment bank in Manhattan. He sends money home every month—not formally, but consistently. His parents' retirement isn't secure; his siblings still need help sometimes. He doesn't complain about this, but it shapes every financial decision he makes.

He lives in Brooklyn because it's cheaper than Manhattan and because the supper club is here. He reconnected with Olivia about three years ago when she spotted him at a coffee shop near his apartment. She waved; he nodded; she came over and talked for forty-five minutes. By the end, he was having dinner at her place that weekend.

He's not sure how he ended up with a group of friends who solve neighborhood mysteries for fun. But he's not leaving.

## Skills
*   Financial analysis—he uses financial modeling to understand everything, not just markets.
*   Attention to detail and pattern recognition.
*   Archery—a hobby that reflects his focused, disciplined nature. It's his stress relief.
*   Code-switching and navigating professional environments where he's underestimated.

## Relationships
*   **Olivia:** Knew her in high school. She reconnected them in Brooklyn. He finds her relentlessly social energy exhausting and comforting in equal measure.
*   **Oliver:** Connects with him over their detail-oriented approach to problem-solving. Respects his quiet competence.
*   **Emma:** Bonds with her over their shared, quiet empathy and less-privileged backgrounds. They understand pressures the others don't.
*   **Noah:** Gets along with him due to their shared systematic thinking—though Noah's tech utopianism sometimes irks him.
*   **Jasper:** Finds him annoying because Jasper reminds him of his privileged college classmates. Uses sarcasm to keep Jasper's chaos in check. Secretly enjoys their dynamic.

## Character Arc
*   To learn to balance his work and personal life, take more risks, and find fulfillment in using his skills to help his friends and community—not just to survive.

## Secrets
*   He secretly dreams of buying a large plot of land upstate and creating a family compound where his extended family could live together, safe and provided for. This romantic ideal clashes with his pragmatic persona—and with the socio-political realities of the communities he'd be buying into. He's never told anyone.
