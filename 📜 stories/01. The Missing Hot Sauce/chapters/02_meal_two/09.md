### Chapter 9: Bringing it to a Simmer
The following Sunday, Emma’s apartment buzzed with a new kind of energy. The familiar comfort of their routine gathering was still there, but it was now shot through with a current of conspiratorial excitement. The air was thick with the aromas of their collective efforts. This week, there was no single chef; the meal was a potluck, an edible reflection of their individual investigations.

Olivia arrived first, carrying not a dish, but a bouquet of fresh flowers and a set of beeswax candles from The Gilded Fern. "Marcus gave me a discount," she announced, already arranging the flowers in a vase. "He's very invested now."

Elijah brought a bright, herbaceous salad of shaved fennel and citrus, ingredients he’d picked up from a market near his office. Oliver, in a rare culinary contribution, had baked a dense, savory mushroom and barley stew, a recipe he said he’d found on a historical cooking subreddit.

Emma, for her part, had taken the wedge of aged cheddar she’d bought from Sofia and transformed it into the base for a decadent, creamy polenta. For dessert, a rustic apple crumble was already warming in the oven.

Noah arrived last, looking slightly flustered. He placed a reusable grocery bag on the counter with a thud. "Okay, so, appetizers," he announced, pulling out a box of artisanal crackers, a tub of hummus, and a wedge of surprisingly expensive-looking cheese. "I did the research. The optimal appetizer-to-dinner ratio suggests something light that doesn't overwhelm the palate. This is the most efficient solution."

Jasper, who was already pouring himself a glass of deep red wine, snorted at Noah, but it was Elijah who spoke. He looked at the bottle of wine Jasper had brought, then at Jasper himself.

"So, Jasper, your contribution to the potluck was... liquidity?" Elijah asked, his voice laced with a dry, sarcastic humor that was sharper than any knife in Emma's kitchen.

Jasper took a dramatic sip of his wine, completely unfazed. "My friend," he said, holding the glass aloft, "I provide social liquidity. I facilitate the free exchange of ideas and bonhomie. It is, by far, the most valuable asset at this table."

Elijah just gave a small, almost imperceptible shake of his head, a silent acknowledgment of Jasper's talent for performative nonsense.

Noah, meanwhile, looked at the bubbling stew on the stove and the array of spices on the counter. "You know," he began, "there are services now that deliver pre-portioned, microwaveable meals. They've optimized the entire nutritional pipeline. It's a much more efficient way to handle caloric intake."

Emma, who was carefully plating Elijah's salad, paused. "Noah, food isn't a pipeline," she said, her voice patient but firm. "It's a story. The process is the point. The chopping, the smelling, the tasting... that's where the soul of it comes from. You can't optimize soul."

"You could if you had the right algorithm," Noah muttered, just loud enough for her to hear. Emma just shook her head, a small smile on her face.

The group settled into their usual spots, the food and wine loosening their tongues. The initial talk was of work and weather, but the unspoken topic hung in the air until Olivia, with her natural flair for the dramatic, couldn't hold it in any longer.

"Alright, nobody's going to say it?" she asked, her eyes sparkling. "Who has the goods? Did we solve it?"

Oliver, ever the pragmatist, was the first to present. "My findings are largely inconclusive," he began, pulling out his phone to read his notes. "There are no public records under the name 'Hank.' However, I did find a permit for a new restaurant on the waterfront filed by a numbered LLC. It's a dead end, legally speaking, but it is an anomaly."

"An anomaly! Ooh, I love that," Olivia chimed in. "Well, my source at The Gilded Fern said Hank was 'jittery' when he came to pull his product. Jittery! That's not a word you use for someone going on vacation."

Emma added her piece next. "And Sofia at the cheese shop said she heard he sold his recipe. Just a rumor, but still."

Elijah, who had been quietly observing, finally spoke up, swirling the wine in his glass. "From a financial perspective," he said, his tone dry, "artisanal condiments are a surprisingly volatile market. A unique, popular recipe could be valued in the low-to-mid six figures, assuming a scalable production model. It's a motive."

A hush fell over the room as the pieces began to click into place. The playful game had suddenly grown legs. It was Noah, surprisingly, who broke the silence. He had pulled out his laptop.

"Okay, wait," he said, a new, genuine curiosity in his voice. "This is more than just a ghost in the machine." His fingers, which had been so dismissive a few days earlier, now moved with a quick, focused intensity. "Oliver, what was that LLC number?"
