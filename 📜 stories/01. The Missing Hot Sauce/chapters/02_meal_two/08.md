### Chapter 8: A Skim and a Call
That evening, Noah finally decided to do his part. He was lounging on his minimalist grey sofa, laptop balanced on his knees. The dinner party had been fun, a pleasant social algorithm with predictable inputs and outputs. The speculation about Hank was an amusing, if illogical, conversational loop. But now, alone in his quiet, orderly apartment, it just felt... inefficient.

People were messy. They did unpredictable things for irrational reasons. Unlike code, they were riddled with bugs that couldn't be patched. To Noah, Hank's disappearance wasn't a mystery; it was a classic example of human fallibility. The man had probably just changed his mind, a frustratingly common and illogical human behavior.

Still, he had a task. He typed "Hank's Hot Sauce Brooklyn" into a search engine. The results were sparse: a few old blog posts, some tagged photos on social media from years ago, and a defunct business listing. He spent a grand total of five minutes on it, his search more of a perfunctory gesture than a genuine investigation.

"See? Nothing," he said to his empty apartment. "The guy's a ghost. Probably just a cash business, no digital footprint." He closed his laptop with a sense of self-satisfied finality. This was exactly what he expected. The real world was messy and analog. If the solution couldn't be found with a simple query, it was probably not a problem worth solving with technology. He made a mental note to tell the group they were chasing a phantom and that a more optimized use of their time would be to find a new, better hot sauce vendor online.

Jasper, on the other hand, was vibrating with energy. He paced his chaotic apartment, a space filled with mismatched furniture and stacks of books on esoteric subjects. For him, the mystery was a thrilling game, a narrative puzzle just waiting for its missing piece. He knew his strength wasn't in the tedious search, but in the connection. He was a coiled spring, waiting for a target.

On Friday, he got it. Oliver sent a group text with the LLC number, a dry, factual message that to Jasper felt like a starter pistol. He didn't hesitate. He sat on a park bench, the city's chaotic energy a perfect match for his own, and scrolled through his phone. He bypassed investigators and officials, landing on a name he hadn't contacted in years: a friend from a past life who now worked in high-end commercial real estate.

"Brenda, my love!" he said into the phone with breathless energy. "I have the most bizarre question for you, it involves hot sauce, a missing person, and possibly a vast corporate conspiracy linked to the Illuminati's control of the global pepper market, you're not going to believe it..." He spent the next ten minutes laying out the entire story with his signature chaotic flair, a whirlwind of speculation and half-facts that somehow managed to convey the core of their discoveries.

Brenda, who had long ago learned to filter Jasper's narrative style for the essential details, was intrigued despite herself. "Jasper, you are a menace," she said, a smile in her voice. "But this is juicy. Let me make a call."

Jasper hung up, beaming. He had done his part. He had connected the dots. The game was afoot.
