## Part Two
### Chapter 6 - A Week of Whispers and Zoning Codes
The week began not with a bang, but with the quiet hum of a city returning to its routine. For the newly formed Supper Club, however, the routine was now layered with a playful, secret purpose.

On Monday afternoon, Olivia was in her element. She stood in "The Gilded Fern," a boutique on Bedford Avenue that sold artisanal soaps, hand-poured candles, and a curated selection of locally made pantry items. The air smelled of lavender and bergamot.

"It's just so strange, isn't it?" Olivia said to the owner, a man named Marcus whose sharp haircut contrasted with his soft cashmere sweater. She ran a hand over a stack of linen tea towels. "One day he's there, the next, poof! Gone."

Marcus leaned against the counter, folding his arms. "I know. Hank was a fixture. A little theatrical for my taste, but his sales were consistent." He lowered his voice. "He came in here last week to pull his inventory. Paid me in cash for the shelf space he was breaking contract on. Seemed... jittery. Kept looking at his phone."

Olivia’s eyes widened with the perfect calibration of concern and intrigue. "Jittery? Oh, you don't think he was in some kind of trouble, do you?" This was exactly the kind of dramatic flair her theory needed.

Meanwhile, three miles away in a silent corner of the New York Public Library, Oliver was engaged in a far less dramatic, but no less focused, investigation. He sat hunched over a laptop, the screen reflecting the glow of the green reading lamp on his face. He wasn't looking for gossip; he was looking for data.

His fingers tapped deliberately across the keyboard, navigating the labyrinthine interface of the Department of Buildings' public database. To an outside observer, it would look like the driest work imaginable. To Oliver, it was a puzzle. He cross-referenced vendor permits for the McCarren Park Greenmarket against new business licenses filed in the last six months. He searched for Hank's name—or what he assumed was his name—in public records, coming up with nothing.

He sighed, adjusting his glasses. Statistically, the most likely answer was the most boring one. Hank had probably just moved. But as he clicked through another zoning application for a new restaurant opening on the Williamsburg waterfront, he paused. The applicant was a numbered LLC, anonymous and sterile. He made a note of it. It was probably nothing, but it was a data point. And Oliver loved data points.

On Tuesday evening, Noah finally decided to do his part. He was lounging on his minimalist grey sofa, laptop balanced on his knees. To him, this whole "mystery" was a simple data retrieval problem. He typed "Hank's Hot Sauce Brooklyn" into a search engine. The results were sparse: a few old blog posts, some tagged photos on social media from years ago, and a defunct business listing. He spent a grand total of five minutes on it.

"See? Nothing," he said to his empty apartment. "The guy's a ghost. Probably just a cash business, no digital footprint." He closed his laptop with a sense of self-satisfied finality. This was exactly what he expected. The real world was messy and analog. If the solution couldn't be found with a simple query, it was probably not a problem worth solving with technology. He made a mental note to tell the group they were chasing a phantom and that a more optimized use of their time would be to find a new, better hot sauce vendor online.

Emma’s research was less a formal investigation and more a series of conversations. On Wednesday, while sourcing ingredients for a freelance gig, she stopped by a cheese shop she frequented. The cheesemonger, a woman with flour dusting her apron, confirmed what the others had said. "Hank? Yeah, he was a character," she said while wrapping a wedge of aged cheddar. "Heard he sold his recipe. Can't blame him. We're all just trying to get by."

Elijah, meanwhile, approached the problem from the only angle that made sense to him: the money. He spent his lunch break on Thursday running a financial analysis. He couldn't find any registered company under Hank's name, but he did find data on the rising market value of artisanal condiments. He built a small, elegant spreadsheet modeling the potential profit margins of a successful hot sauce brand. It was, he concluded with a touch of surprise, a potentially lucrative business. It was enough to make a person... competitive.

Finally, on Friday, Jasper decided it was time to activate his own unique network. He sat on a park bench, scrolling through his phone. He bypassed investigators and officials, landing on a name he hadn't contacted in years: a friend from a past life who now worked in high-end commercial real estate.

"Brenda, my love!" he said into the phone with breathless energy. "I have the most bizarre question for you, it involves hot sauce, a missing person, and possibly a vast corporate conspiracy, you're not going to believe it..." He spent the next ten minutes laying out the entire story with his signature chaotic flair. Brenda, intrigued despite herself, promised to look into the LLC Oliver had found. Jasper hung up, beaming. He had done his part.
