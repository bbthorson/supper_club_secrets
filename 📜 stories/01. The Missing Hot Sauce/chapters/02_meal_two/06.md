## Part Two
### Chapter Six - Sifting the Evidence
Monday afternoon, three miles away from the curated chatter of Bedford Avenue, Oliver sat in a silent corner of the New York Public Library's Rose Main Reading Room. The vast, cathedral-like space was a sanctuary for him, a place where the chaotic city outside was reduced to a muted, distant hum. He sat hunched over a laptop, the screen reflecting the warm, soft glow of the iconic green reading lamp on his face. He wasn't looking for gossip; he was looking for data.

To an outside observer, the work would have looked soul-crushingly dull. He was navigating the labyrinthine, notoriously user-unfriendly interface of the Department of Buildings' public database. But to Oliver, it was a puzzle, a system of rules and records that, if properly interrogated, could be made to reveal its secrets. His fingers didn't fly across the keyboard; they tapped with a deliberate, methodical rhythm, each keystroke a precise and considered action.

He started with the basics, cross-referencing vendor permits for the McCarren Park Greenmarket against new business licenses filed in the last six months. He searched for Hank's name—or what he assumed was his name, "Henry"—in public records, a digital trawl that yielded hundreds of irrelevant results. He sighed, adjusting his glasses. Statistically, the most likely answer was the most boring one. Hank had probably retired, moved to Florida, or simply decided to stop selling hot sauce. There was no data to support aliens.

Still, the group had committed to the investigation, and Oliver, despite his skepticism, was a man who followed through on his commitments. He shifted his search, looking not for a person, but for a pattern. He began meticulously combing through every new LLC and business permit filed in Williamsburg in the last year. It was a digital needle in a haystack. Hours passed. The light outside the grand, arched windows began to fade.

Just as he was about to pack up, he found it. An application for a new restaurant opening on the Williamsburg waterfront. The applicant was a numbered LLC, anonymous and sterile. It was probably nothing, but it was an anomaly, a data point that didn't fit the established pattern. He downloaded the relevant documents, his heart giving a small, unfamiliar flutter of excitement. He had found something.
