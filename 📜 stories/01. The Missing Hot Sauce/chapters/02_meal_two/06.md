## Meal Two

### Chapter Six - A Fine Sieve

Monday afternoon, three miles away from the curated chatter of Bedford Avenue, Oliver sat in a silent corner of the New York Public Library's Rose Main Reading Room. The vast, cathedral-like space was a sanctuary for him, a place where the chaotic city outside was reduced to a muted, distant hum. He sat hunched over a laptop, the screen reflecting the warm, soft glow of the iconic green reading lamp on his face. He wasn't looking for gossip; he was looking for data.

To an outside observer, the work would have looked soul-crushingly dull. He was navigating the labyrinthine, notoriously user-unfriendly interface of the Department of Buildings' public database. But to Oliver, it was a puzzle, a system of rules and records that, if properly interrogated, could be made to reveal its secrets. His fingers didn't fly across the keyboard; they tapped with a deliberate, methodical rhythm, each keystroke a precise and considered action.

He'd always loved this room. As a kid, he'd color-coded his bookshelf by genre and author, arranged his action figures by height and fictional universe, sorted his baseball cards using a system so complex his father had given up trying to understand it. His mother had worried it was obsessive. His father had just shrugged and said, "At least we know where everything is."

The database was like that childhood bookshelf—chaotic on the surface, but with an underlying logic waiting to be discovered. You just had to be patient enough to find it.

He started with the basics, cross-referencing vendor permits for the McCarren Park Greenmarket against new business licenses filed in the last six months. He searched for Hank's name—or what he assumed was his name, "Henry"—in public records, a digital trawl that yielded hundreds of irrelevant results. Henry Chen, Henry Rodriguez, Henry Williams. None of them connected to hot sauce or farmers markets. He sighed, adjusting his glasses. 

Statistically, the most likely answer was the most boring one. Hank had probably retired, moved to Florida, or simply decided to stop selling hot sauce. There was no data to support aliens, and barely any to support the wild theories his friends had spun over wine.

But still.

The group had committed to the investigation, and Oliver, despite his skepticism, was a man who followed through on his commitments. It was one of the things Olivia loved about him—his reliability, his steady presence. "You're my anchor," she'd told him once. He'd appreciated the sentiment, even as part of him wished he could be more like Jasper, more spontaneous, less... predictable.

He shifted his search, looking not for a person, but for a pattern. He began meticulously combing through every new LLC and business permit filed in Williamsburg in the last year. It was a digital needle in a haystack. Hours passed. The light outside the grand, arched windows began to fade from gold to gray. Around him, other library patrons packed up their things, heading home for dinner. Oliver barely noticed.

He was on page forty-seven of business permits when a librarian approached, her footsteps soft on the marble floor.

"We're closing in thirty minutes," she said gently.

Oliver nodded without looking up. "Just a few more minutes."

She smiled—she'd seen him here before, always at the same desk, always with the same intense focus—and moved on to warn the next patron.

Just as he was about to pack up, admit defeat, and head home empty-handed, he found it. 

An application for a new restaurant opening on the Williamsburg waterfront. The applicant was listed as LLC #2847, a numbered entity with no names attached. Anonymous and sterile. Filed on October 18th—exactly two days after Hank had given up his stall at the farmers market.

It was probably nothing. Corporate entities filed anonymous LLCs all the time for perfectly legitimate reasons. But it was an anomaly, a data point that didn't fit the established pattern. In a dataset full of named applicants—"Giovanni's Trattoria LLC," "Brooklyn Burger Holdings," "Chen Family Restaurant Group"—one numbered entity stood out like a sore thumb.

Oliver downloaded the relevant documents, his heart giving a small, unfamiliar flutter of excitement. The filing included an address—a waterfront property that had been vacant for months—and a projected opening date of December 1st. Fast. Suspiciously fast for a new restaurant.

He sat back, staring at the screen, his methodical mind already building connections. If someone wanted to push Hank out, they'd need a reason. And if they wanted his market stall location, they'd need to move quickly before someone else claimed it.

He had found something. Maybe not proof, but definitely a thread worth pulling.

Oliver packed up his laptop and headed for the exit, already composing the text he'd send to the group. Outside, the October evening had turned cold, but he barely felt it. For the first time since this silly investigation had started, he understood why his friends found this exciting.

There was a pattern here. He just had to keep looking.
