### Chapter Ten: Flash in the Pan
Oliver recited the number from his notes. Noah's eyes scanned the screen, a flicker of recognition in them. "Okay... okay, wow. This is not a small-time operation. That LLC is a subsidiary of a much larger hospitality group. One that was just granted a series of patents for... get this... 'shelf-stable capsicum-based flavor enhancers.'"

"Hot sauce," Emma whispered, her eyes wide.

The room was electric. The scattered, flimsy threads of their individual "investigations" had woven themselves into a single, tangible tapestry. It wasn't aliens or the CIA, but it was something real. Something unscrupulous.

"They're stealing his recipe," Elijah said, the statement hanging in the air with a newfound weight. "That's what this is."

A wave of righteous excitement washed over the group. They had done it. They had actually solved it.

"I knew it!" Emma exclaimed, a grin spreading across her face. "It was Big Hot Sauce!"

"This is incredible," Noah said, looking up from his laptop with a genuine sense of wonder. "The data actually correlated. We followed the data and it led us to the truth." He couldn't hide the satisfaction in his voice; for once, the messy real world had aligned with the clean logic he preferred.

Olivia was already planning their next move, her voice buzzing with energy. "We have to tell someone! We to expose them! This is a story! A real, live story!"

It was then that Jasper, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, stood up, puffing out his chest with a triumphant smile.

"Way ahead of you," he announced.

The group turned to look at him.

"What do you mean?" Elijah asked, his brow furrowing.

"Well, when Oliver found that LLC, I couldn't just let it sit there," Jasper said, beaming. "So I called my friend Brenda in commercial real estate. Told her the whole story. And she just texted me back. She confirmed it. That LLC? It belongs to the restaurant mogul who's been buying up half of Williamsburg. She said he's notorious for this kind of thing."

He looked around the room, expecting a round of applause. This time, he got it. A chorus of whoops and cheers erupted.

"Jasper, you beautiful man!" Olivia cried out, raising her glass.

"I can't believe it actually worked," Noah said, shaking his head in disbelief.

Jasper took a theatrical bow. "Never doubt the network," he said with a wink.

The rest of the dinner was a celebration. They toasted their success, their cleverness, their friendship. They had stared into the weird, chaotic heart of a Brooklyn mystery and, against all odds, they had won. As the night wound down and they said their goodbyes, the group was buoyant, floating on a shared cloud of victory. They felt like they could do anything. They were a team. They were detectives. And they were completely unaware that their cover had just been blown.
