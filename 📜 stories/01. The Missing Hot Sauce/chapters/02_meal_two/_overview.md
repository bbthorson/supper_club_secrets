# Meal 2: Confrontation

## Key Events
* **Breaking into Act 2:** The week begins with a montage of the friends "researching" their wild theories. Initially, the mood is playful, an excuse to get together and not talk about work. Each friend, however, independently discovers a small, fishy detail, though nothing that seems truly alarming on its own.
* **Fun and Games:** The group gathers for the second supper club. As they share their findings, the collective evidence starts to paint a more serious picture. The initial playful mood gradually transforms into a genuine investment in solving the quandary, as they become more convinced that something unscrupulous has happened.
* **Midpoint:** The investigation takes a serious turn when the group pools their information. The combination of Emma's market intel, Olivia's gossip, Oliver's zoning research, and Noah's patent search leads them to a single restaurant mogul. The mood shifts from curiosity to excitement as they realize they've stumbled onto a real conspiracy.
* **Breakthrough & Setback:** Fueled by a desire to get justice for Hank, the group gets hyped up. In the excitement, Jasper makes a call to a contact to confirm their suspicions. The act ends with the group feeling clever and triumphant, believing they have the upper hand and are a step ahead of the mogul.
