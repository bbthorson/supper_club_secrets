## Meal 2 - Confrontation
### Breaking into Act 2
* We start with a montage of characters deciding what they’re going to make and “researching” their various conspiracies:
    * **Emma:** Uses her food industry connections, subtly probing suppliers and local chefs for any unusual activity related to hot sauce distribution or Hank.
    * **Elijah:** Conducts a deep financial analysis of the restaurant mogul's public records, looking for unusual investments or shell corporations.
    * **Noah:** Scours the dark web, sets up digital alerts for keywords, and looks for any online presence of Hank that might have been scrubbed.
    * **Jasper:** Calls his network of eccentric contacts, pursuing outlandish leads that might unexpectedly yield a kernel of truth.
    * **Oliver:** Dives into city zoning laws and permits, looking for irregularities in new business registrations in Williamsburg.
    * **Olivia:** Continues her social rounds, gathering neighborhood gossip from shop owners, baristas, and dog walkers, piecing together a timeline of Hank's last known movements.

### B Story
> I think I want to have **Emma** filming risque content for an OnlyFans - nothing raunchy, but like selling feet pics - which the restaurant mogul will use against her later. I need to come back to this, but I think **Emma** needs to be particularly exposed, likely economically, before they confront the villain.

### Fun and Games
* Information gathering - they all come to **Emma’s** and start showing off their dishes and sharing intel
* Red herrings and false leads
* Character dynamics and conflicts emerge

### Midpoint
* **Elijah** starts to pull certain threads together based on all their fun, unserious discovery work.
* This should likely be a combination of **Emma’s** farmer’s market intel and **Olivia’s** neighborhood gossip.
* **Oliver** borrows **Noah’s** computer to look up zoning records and discovers a new shop set to open in downtown Williamsburg by the restaurant owner.
* **Noah** then finds a bunch of recently filed patents around hot sauce attached to the restaurant owner.
* **Jasper** calls somebody he knows in commercial real estate and confirms their suspicions. This tips off the restaurant mogul.
