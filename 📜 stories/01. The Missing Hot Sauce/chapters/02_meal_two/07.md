### Chapter 7: The Second Supper
The following Sunday, Emma’s apartment buzzed with a new kind of energy. The familiar comfort of their routine gathering was still there, but it was now shot through with a current of conspiratorial excitement. The air was thick with the aromas of their collective efforts: a rich, savory stew from Oliver and Olivia, a bright, herbaceous salad from Elijah, and the sweet scent of cinnamon from Emma’s dessert warming in the oven.

Noah arrived last, looking slightly flustered. He placed a reusable grocery bag on the counter with a thud. "Okay, so, appetizers," he announced, pulling out a box of artisanal crackers, a tub of hummus, and a wedge of surprisingly expensive-looking cheese. "I did the research. The optimal appetizer-to-dinner ratio suggests something light that doesn't overwhelm the palate. This is the most efficient solution."

Jasper, who was already pouring himself a glass of deep red wine, snorted. "You mean you forgot until an hour ago and ran to the bodega?"

"I'm choosing to ignore that," Noah said, meticulously arranging the crackers on a plate.

The group settled into their usual spots, the food and wine loosening their tongues. The initial talk was of work and weather, but the unspoken topic hung in the air until Olivia, with her natural flair for the dramatic, couldn't hold it in any longer.

"Alright, nobody's going to say it?" she asked, her eyes sparkling. "Who has the goods? Did we solve it?"

Oliver, ever the pragmatist, was the first to present. "My findings are largely inconclusive," he began, pulling out his phone to read his notes. "There are no public records under the name 'Hank.' However, I did find a permit for a new restaurant on the waterfront filed by a numbered LLC. It's a dead end, legally speaking, but it is an anomaly."

"An anomaly! Ooh, I love that," Olivia chimed in. "Well, my source at The Gilded Fern said Hank was 'jittery' when he came to pull his product. Jittery! That's not a word you use for someone going on vacation."

Emma added her piece next. "And the cheesemonger I spoke to said she heard he sold his recipe. Just a rumor, but still."

Elijah, who had been quietly observing, finally spoke up, swirling the wine in his glass. "From a financial perspective," he said, his tone dry, "artisanal condiments are a surprisingly volatile market. A unique, popular recipe could be valued in the low-to-mid six figures, assuming a scalable production model. It's a motive."

A hush fell over the room as the pieces began to click into place. The playful game had suddenly grown legs. It was Noah, surprisingly, who broke the silence. He had pulled out his laptop.

"Okay, wait," he said, his fingers tapping across the keyboard. "Oliver, what was that LLC number?"

Oliver recited it from his notes. Noah's eyes scanned the screen. "Okay... okay, wow. That LLC is a subsidiary of a much larger hospitality group. One that was just granted a series of patents for... get this... 'shelf-stable capsicum-based flavor enhancers.'"

"Hot sauce," Emma whispered, her eyes wide.

The room was electric. The scattered, flimsy threads of their individual "investigations" had woven themselves into a single, tangible tapestry. It wasn't aliens or the CIA, but it was something real. Something unscrupulous.

"They're stealing his recipe," Elijah said, the statement hanging in the air with a newfound weight. "That's what this is."
