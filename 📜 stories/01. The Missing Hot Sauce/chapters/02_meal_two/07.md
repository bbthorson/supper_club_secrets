### Chapter Seven: Gathering the Ingredients
While Oliver was mining for data, Olivia was in her natural habitat, gathering a different kind of intelligence. On Tuesday, she stood in "The Gilded Fern," a boutique on Bedford Avenue that sold artisanal soaps, hand-poured candles, and a curated selection of locally made pantry items. The air smelled of lavender and bergamot.

"It's just so strange, isn't it?" Olivia said to the owner, a man named Marcus whose sharp haircut contrasted with his soft cashmere sweater. She ran a hand over a stack of linen tea towels, her movements casual, her purpose anything but. "One day he's there, the next, poof! Gone."

Marcus leaned against the counter, folding his arms. "I know. Hank was a fixture. A little theatrical for my taste, but his sales were consistent." He lowered his voice, the signal Olivia had been waiting for. "He came in here last week to pull his inventory. Paid me in cash for the shelf space he was breaking contract on. Seemed... jittery. Kept looking at his phone."

Olivia’s eyes widened with the perfect calibration of concern and intrigue, a performance she had perfected over years of neighborhood networking. "Jittery? Oh, you don't think he was in some kind of trouble, do you?" This was exactly the kind of dramatic flair her romantic theory needed.

"I don't know," Marcus said, polishing a glass jar of fig jam. "But it wasn't normal. He looked like a man who was running from something."

That evening, Olivia returned to their apartment, buzzing from the thrill of the chase. She found Oliver at his desk, staring intently at his laptop screen, a cup of tea growing cold beside him.

"You will not believe what Marcus told me," she began, launching into a dramatic retelling of her conversation, complete with hushed tones and wide-eyed reenactments.

Oliver listened patiently, a small smile on his face. When she was finished, he simply nodded. "That's a useful anecdote," he said.

"An anecdote? Ollie, it's a clue! He was 'jittery'! He was 'running from something'!"

"Those are subjective interpretations of his emotional state," Oliver said, but there was no malice in his voice. "I, on the other hand, have found a piece of objective data." He turned his laptop toward her, showing her the screen. "An anonymous LLC has filed a permit for a new restaurant on the waterfront. The filing date was two days after Hank gave up his stall."

Olivia leaned in, her playful, public persona melting away, replaced by a genuine, focused curiosity. She knew how Oliver's mind worked. He wasn't a storyteller; he was a pattern-finder. And he had found a break in the pattern.

"Okay," she said, her voice soft and encouraging. "So, what does that mean? Walk me through it. What's the hypothetical scenario here?"

"The hypothetical scenario," Oliver said, a spark of excitement in his own eyes, "is that someone wanted Hank's prime market location, and they are using an anonymous corporate shell to hide their identity. It's a common tactic in hostile real estate acquisitions."

"See?" Olivia said, squeezing his shoulder. "That's not boring at all. That's a real lead. A better lead than mine." She smiled. "You're going to blow them away on Sunday."

Emma’s research was less a formal investigation and more a series of conversations. On Wednesday, while sourcing ingredients for a freelance gig, she stopped by a cheese shop she frequented. The cheesemonger, a woman named Sofia with flour dusting her apron, had been a neighborhood fixture for twenty years.

"Hank? Yeah, he was a character," Sofia said while wrapping a wedge of aged cheddar in wax paper. "A real artist, that one. Passionate."

"Did he seem okay to you, the last time you saw him?" Emma asked, leaning against the counter.

Sofia paused, her knife hovering over a wheel of parmesan. "You know, it's funny you should ask. He came in here a couple of weeks ago, asking all sorts of questions about bottling and shelf life. Said he'd gotten a big offer, a chance to 'go legit.' I told him to be careful. These big companies, they don't care about the art. They just want the recipe." She shrugged. "Heard he took the deal. Can't blame him. We're all just trying to get by."

The word "deal" echoed in Emma's mind as she walked home. It wasn't aliens, and it wasn't a kidnapping. It was something far more common, and in its own way, far more sinister.
