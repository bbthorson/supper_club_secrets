### Chapter Seven: Gathering the Ingredients
Tuesday morning, Olivia was in her natural habitat, gathering a different kind of intelligence. She stood in "The Gilded Fern," a boutique on Bedford Avenue that sold artisanal soaps, hand-poured candles, and a curated selection of locally made pantry items. The air smelled of lavender and bergamot.

"It's just so strange, isn't it?" Olivia said to the owner, a man named Marcus whose sharp haircut contrasted with his soft cashmere sweater. She ran a hand over a stack of linen tea towels, her movements casual, her purpose anything but. "One day he's there, the next, poof! Gone."

Marcus leaned against the counter, folding his arms. "I know. Hank was a fixture. A little theatrical for my taste, but his sales were consistent." He lowered his voice, the signal Olivia had been waiting for. "He came in here last week to pull his inventory. Paid me in cash for the shelf space he was breaking contract on. Seemed... jittery. Kept looking at his phone."

Olivia’s eyes widened with the perfect calibration of concern and intrigue, a performance she had perfected over years of neighborhood networking. "Jittery? Oh, you don't think he was in some kind of trouble, do you?" This was exactly the kind of dramatic flair her romantic theory needed.

"I don't know," Marcus said, polishing a glass jar of fig jam. "But it wasn't normal. He looked like a man who was running from something."

That evening, Olivia returned to their apartment, buzzing from the thrill of the chase. She found Oliver at his desk, staring intently at his laptop screen, a cup of tea growing cold beside him.

"You will not believe what Marcus told me," she began, launching into a dramatic retelling of her conversation, complete with hushed tones and wide-eyed reenactments.

Oliver listened patiently, a small smile on his face. When she was finished, he simply nodded. "That's a useful anecdote," he said.

"An anecdote? Ollie, it's a clue! He was 'jittery'! He was 'running from something'!"

"Those are subjective interpretations of his emotional state," Oliver said, but there was no malice in his voice. "I, on the other hand, have found a piece of objective data." He turned his laptop toward her, showing her the screen. "An anonymous LLC has filed a permit for a new restaurant on the waterfront. The filing date was two days after Hank gave up his stall."

Olivia leaned in, her playful, public persona melting away, replaced by a genuine, focused curiosity. She knew how Oliver's mind worked. He wasn't a storyteller; he was a pattern-finder. And he had found a break in the pattern.

"Okay," she said, her voice soft and encouraging. "So, what does that mean? Walk me through it. What's the hypothetical scenario here?"

"The hypothetical scenario," Oliver said, a spark of excitement in his own eyes, "is that someone wanted Hank's prime market location, and they are using an anonymous corporate shell to hide their identity. It's a common tactic in hostile real estate acquisitions."

"See?" Olivia said, squeezing his shoulder. "That's not boring at all. That's a real lead. A better lead than mine." She smiled. "You're going to blow them away on Sunday."

Wednesday afternoon, Emma's research was less a formal investigation and more a series of conversations. While sourcing ingredients for a freelance gig, she stopped by a cheese shop she frequented. The cheesemonger, a woman named Sofia with flour dusting her apron, had been a neighborhood fixture for twenty years.

"Hank? Yeah, he was a character," Sofia said while wrapping a wedge of aged cheddar in wax paper. "A real artist, that one. Passionate."

"Did he seem okay to you, the last time you saw him?" Emma asked, leaning against the counter.

Sofia paused, her knife hovering over a wheel of parmesan. "You know, it's funny you should ask. He came in here a couple of weeks ago, asking all sorts of questions about bottling and shelf life. Said he'd gotten a big offer, a chance to 'go legit.' I told him to be careful. These big companies, they don't care about the art. They just want the recipe." She shrugged. "Heard he took the deal. Can't blame him. We're all just trying to get by."

The word "deal" echoed in Emma's mind as she walked home. It wasn't aliens, and it wasn't a kidnapping. It was something far more common, and in its own way, far more sinister.

That same Wednesday, in a glass-walled conference room forty floors above Midtown, Elijah approached the problem from the only angle that made sense to him: the money. He spent his lunch break not eating, but building a spreadsheet. His work was elegant and efficient, the formulas flowing from his fingertips with a practiced ease.

His pragmatism was a survival strategy. As the first in his family to go to college, he lacked the professional and financial safety net that so many of his colleagues took for granted. For him, a mystery was an intellectual curiosity, but a financial model was a tool for understanding the world.

He couldn't find any registered company under Hank's name, but he did find data on the rising market value of artisanal condiments. He built a small, elegant model, projecting the potential profit margins of a successful hot sauce brand, factoring in production costs, distribution, and brand recognition. He was surprised by the result. It was a potentially lucrative business, easily valued in the low-to-mid six figures. It was enough to make a person... competitive.


He leaned back, looking at the clean, logical lines of his spreadsheet. He was still skeptical. The idea of a "hot sauce conspiracy" felt like something out of one of Jasper's fever dreams. But the numbers didn't lie. There was a motive here. A strong one. And for a man who spent his days analyzing risk and reward, a strong motive was the first sign of a logical, predictable pattern.

He texted the group chat: Found something interesting. Financial model suggests artisanal hot sauce brand could be worth low-to-mid six figures. That's serious money. See you Sunday.

For the first time, he allowed himself to think that his friends might actually be onto something.
