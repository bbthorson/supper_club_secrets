### Chapter 5 - Spicing Up The Search
Jasper stood up, a beaming smile of purple teeth. “Elijah, are you saying you WANT to hang out with us two weeks in a row?” He paused for dramatic effect. “WHAT IF we do this dinner thing again, except next week we all bring a dish that helps justify your theory?”

The group groaned in unison, but their feigned disappointment was quickly replaced by a renewed sense of excitement. A real-life mystery to solve? This was even better than their tipsy theorizing.

Emma stood up. “I’m in. I miss Hank. Can’t hurt asking around a little more. But can somebody else handle the entree? I don’t want to be selfish, but I’m not sure I’ve got the energy to do everything.”

Olivia, ever the planner, chimed in before anyone could reach for a number. "Hold on, Jasper. Oliver and I will handle the entree. It's the most work, and there are two of us." She shot a playful glance at her husband, who merely nodded in agreement. "I'll get extra creative with ingredients from all the local shops. There's bound to be some neighborhood gossip."

"And I'll see what kind of permits farmer's markets have to file," Oliver added.

"You can't eat city permits," Jasper said impatiently. He grabbed the cap and shook it. "Alright, here's what's left: One is wine, two is appetizers, three is the second course, and five is dessert."

Elijah reached in and drew a number. "Three," he said. "The second course."

"You know I love you, bud, but can you please not make a quinoa salad with a bunch of raw vegetables?" Noah asked, his voice peaking with genuine anxiety.

"Why do you say that?" Elijah asked, looking around the room. Nobody responded, their silence speaking volumes.

Jasper, wanting to move on, tapped Emma on the head with the hat. She reached in, took out a number, and said, "I got dessert. I'll head to some specialty stores and find some fun ingredients. Should be perfect to implicate Big Hot Sauce."

Noah didn't wait. He reached into the hat and snatched out a number. "One."

"Oh, God," Emma accidentally blurted out.

"What!?" Noah snapped back.

"C’mon, Noah. I wasn't even here to sample your wine choice from tonight, and I know it sucked," Elijah added in Emma's defense.

Noah looked annoyed. "You wanna get the wine, Jasper?" he said, tossing the paper at him.

"Hell yeah," Jasper said, catching it. "I needed to talk to the wine merchant down the block about Russian CIA aliens anyway."

"Okay, but are we, like, actually taking this seriously?" Noah asked, ever the pragmatist. "Or is this just an excuse to drink more of Jasper’s fancy-label wine?"

Jasper, who had been making his way to the door, spun around with a wounded expression. "Hey! I’ll have you know the wine merchant and I are on a first-name basis. And for the record, I am taking this very seriously." He puffed out his chest. "In fact, I’ll probably have this whole thing solved by Tuesday. I know people. Very important people."

Olivia rolled her eyes, a smile playing on her lips. "Of course you do, dear. Just try not to get us all arrested before the appetizers are served next week, okay?"

"It’s settled then," Elijah said, looking around at his funny group of friends, his Brooklyn family. "We’re all meeting here next week, dish in hand, with our definitive research as to what happened to Hank."

He raised his glass. As they clinked their glasses together, a shared sense of purpose filled the room. The hot sauce vendor might be missing, but the adventure was just coming into view.
