### Chapter 3 - A Simmering Suspicion
Emma's cozy Brooklyn apartment was filled with the familiar sounds of her closest friends - lively chatter, the clink of wine glasses, and the sizzle of something delicious coming from the kitchen. The mismatched furniture, a blend of hand-me-downs and street finds, gave the space an eclectic, lived-in charm. Despite its humble size, the apartment felt warm and inviting, a reflection of Emma's generous spirit.

The door buzzed again. “ELIJAH!” a chorus sounded out.

Oliver got up from his perch on the loveseat to greet their friend at the door. “Hey E, report go okay?”

“Hey Ollie, hey gang. Report went fine, just a lot of reference checking. It's not hard work, just tedious,” he replied. “Wine?” He said holding up a bottle. Elijah was tall and thin with hip glasses. His hair was well manicured and had a distinctly more put together vibe than the rest of the crew.

Jasper, sprawled in one of the rickety folding chairs, greeted Elijah with a mischievous grin, his teeth stained purple from the wine. “Mate, keep the bottle for yourself. You're going to need to catch up.”

“Hi Elijah, ignore Jasper. I've got food in the oven for you and there's a clean glass on the counter. You can have this luxurious milk crate, I'll move to the floor,” Emma said as she slid down to the floor and moved her wine glass over on the coffee table.

Elijah settled onto the milk-crate-turned-chair, taking a moment to survey the scene before him. His brow furrowed slightly, a sign that the analytical wheels in his mind were already turning. "Alright, so what did I miss? The crew seems to be really into something," he asked, taking a big bite of the spaghetti squash Emma had prepared.

“So,” Jasper started.

“No!” Emma, Noah, and Olivia shouted in unison. “Oliver, mind doing the honors?” Emma added.

Oliver looked at Jasper as if seeking his approval, but Jasper wasn't really paying attention. “Uh, sure.”

He continued, “Ems's a little disappointed in dinner, not because it's bad or anything, it's amazing like always, she just wanted to make something a little different.”

“Get to the point!” interrupted Jasper, smirking as always.

“That's rich coming from you,” Olivia snapped back, less forgiving than the rest of the group.

“Anyway, Ems wanted to buy some hot sauce from a guy at the farmer's market this morning, but he wasn't there. The other vendors said he's always there, but that he was a little off last week and then abruptly canceled his stall this week.”

“This guy is soooo sweet,” Emma added, sounding a bit tipsy.

“Right, so while we were eating, Liv texted a boutique owner that she thought might've carried the hot sauce. They carry some of her candles, so they're on texting terms. Anyway, he responded like 20 minutes ago and said that he used to have some of the hot sauce on his shelves, but last week, the guy showed up and took all of his inventory back. The boutique owner didn't outright say it, but we all read Liv’s texts and it sounds like he thinks something is going on, but didn't say it, obviously.”

Elijah, the only sober person in the room, looked around at everyone's faces. They seemed to be sitting in the edge of their makeshift seating, well everyone except Emma, who was leaning on him for a little support.

“And so you all have been doing what? Drinking wine and speculating about this stranger's life?” Elijah asked. 

“He's not a stranger!” Jasper responded. 

“Well actually, he very much is, because we only think we know his first name,” Noah corrected. 

“Elijah, listen, he's this super personable guy. He's always chatting up everyone at the farmer's market. It's all just kind of weird,” Emma said looking up at him.

Oliver, looking to conclude his narration duties, jumped back in. “To be honest, we'd been making up theories about what happened and we figured you could be the judge when you go here, cuz, ya know, you've had a few less glasses of wine.”

“Ha, good lord. Okay. The crew truly next disappoints,” Elijah agreed with a smile. “So I assume Liv has a plan?”

“Why would you assume that?” Olivia responded before quickly resuming. “Okay, so what I was thinking was that we could all draw a number and then pitch you our theory in order and then you can choose which one you like best.”

“Like best? Any points for believability?” Elijah asked, taking a big gulp of wine and refilling his glass.

“Absolutely not!” interjected Jasper.

Olivia shrugged, “I mean, believable? Yeah, a little bit, otherwise who knows what Jasper is going to do. But also, we're just having fun.”

“So you already have the numbers written on bits of paper in a hat, right?” Olivia reached behind her and handed a hat to Elijah. “Liv, you're the most predictable, unpredictable person. Alright, let's play this insane game.”

“Drum.roll please.” Elijah shook the hat up and held it down to Emma. She reached in and pulled out the first piece of paper. “Number 2. I guess that's okay. I'm going to grab some water before my turn. Anybody want some?” Oliver held up his hand. 

Elijah leaned over Emma to Noah. He pulled out a number and said, “5,” with a disappointed look on his face.

Next up, Olivia. “Number 3! I'll hold this whole thing together.”

Oliver stood up and leaned over the coffee table. “I really don't want to do this.” Elijah shook the hat. “Number 1,” Oliver sighed.

“Oh God damnit,” Noah immediately said. 

“OH GOD BLESS IT, BABY,” Jasper stood up with his hands over his head. 

“Anybody want to change?” Noah asked. After a few seconds, he accepted the order and slouched in his folding chair. 

Elijah slowly looked around the room, tapping his fingers together, and said in a deep voice, “The order has been set. May the odds be ever in your favor.”
