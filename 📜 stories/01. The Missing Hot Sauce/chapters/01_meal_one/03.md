### Chapter Three - A Simmering Suspicion
The door buzzed again, this time with a staccato insistence that announced the arrival of their final guest. A chorus of "ELIJAH!" rang out as Oliver rose to greet their friend.

"Hey E, report go okay?" Oliver asked as Elijah stepped inside, shrugging off his jacket.

"Hey Ollie, hey gang," he replied, his eyes scanning the room. "Report went fine. Just a lot of reference checking. It's not hard work, just tedious." He held up a bottle of wine. "Am I too late to contribute?"

Elijah was tall and thin, with hip glasses and well-manicured hair that gave him a distinctly more put-together vibe than the rest of the crew. He was the only one who looked like he had come from an actual office and not a co-working space or a kitchen.

Jasper, sprawled in one of the rickety folding chairs, greeted him with a mischievous grin, his teeth stained purple from the wine. "Mate, keep the bottle for yourself. You're going to need to catch up."

"Hi Elijah, ignore Jasper," Emma said, sliding off the milk crate she’d been perched on. "I've got food in the oven for you, and there's a clean glass on the counter. You can have this luxurious seat; I'll move to the floor."

Elijah settled onto the milk-crate-turned-chair, taking a moment to survey the scene. His brow furrowed slightly, a sign that the analytical wheels in his mind were already turning. "Alright, so what did I miss?" he asked, taking a big bite of the spaghetti squash Emma had prepared. "The crew seems to be really into something."

"So," Jasper started, eager to dominate the narrative.

"No!" Emma, Noah, and Olivia shouted in unison. "Oliver, mind doing the honors?" Emma added.

Oliver, looking slightly pained to be the center of attention, cleared his throat. "Uh, sure." He continued, "Ems's a little disappointed in dinner—not because it's bad or anything, it's amazing like always—she just wanted to make something a little different."

"Get to the point!" interrupted Jasper, smirking.

"That's rich coming from you," Olivia snapped back, her patience with Jasper wearing thin.

"Anyway," Oliver pressed on, "Ems wanted to buy some hot sauce from a guy at the farmer's market this morning, but he wasn't there. The other vendors said he's always there, but that he was a little off last week and then abruptly canceled his stall this week."

"This guy is soooo sweet," Emma added, her voice a bit tipsy.

"Right," Oliver continued, picking up the thread. "So while we were eating, Liv texted a boutique owner that she thought might've carried the hot sauce. They carry some of her candles, so they're on texting terms. Anyway, he responded like twenty minutes ago and said that he used to have some of the hot sauce on his shelves, but last week, the guy showed up and took all of his inventory back. The boutique owner didn't outright say it, but we all read Liv’s texts, and it sounds like he thinks something is going on."

Elijah, the only sober person in the room, looked at their expectant faces. "And so you all have been doing what? Drinking wine and speculating about this stranger's life?"

"He's not a stranger!" Jasper responded indignantly.

"Well, actually, he very much is, because we only think we know his first name," Noah corrected, ever the pedant.

"Elijah, listen, he's this super personable guy," Emma said, looking up at him from her spot on the floor. "He's always chatting up everyone at the farmer's market. It's all just kind of weird."

Oliver, looking to conclude his narration duties, jumped back in. "To be honest, we'd been making up theories about what happened, and we figured you could be the judge when you got here, 'cause, ya know, you've had a few less glasses of wine."

Elijah let out a short laugh. "Ha, good lord. Okay. The crew truly never disappoints," he agreed with a smile. "So I assume Liv has a plan?"

"Why would you assume that?" Olivia responded before quickly resuming. "Okay, so what I was thinking was that we could all draw a number and then pitch you our theory in order, and then you can choose which one you like best."

"Like best? Any points for believability?" Elijah asked, finally taking a big gulp of his own wine.

"Absolutely not!" interjected Jasper.

Olivia shrugged. "I mean, believable? Yeah, a little bit, otherwise who knows what Jasper is going to do. But also, we're just having fun."

"So you already have the numbers written on bits of paper in a hat, right?" Elijah asked, a knowing look on his face. Olivia reached behind a cushion and produced a baseball cap. "Liv, you're the most predictable, unpredictable person. Alright, let's play this insane game."
