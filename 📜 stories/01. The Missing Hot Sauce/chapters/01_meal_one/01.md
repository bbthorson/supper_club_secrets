### Chapter One - The Missing Hot Sauce
The crisp air of an early October nipped at Emma's face as she exited her apartment on Richardson Street. She didn't know then, but this unseasonably chilly morning was about to change her life forever.
She'd recently left her job as sous chef at an aging New York bistro. The only thing more tired than her were their recipes. Emma had always been a passionate cook, but the long hours and rigid hierarchy of the restaurant world had slowly sapped her creativity and joy. Now, with a few freelance writing gigs and plans to boost her social media presence, she was hopeful about forging a new path.
Today, she had invited her closest friends over to her cozy Brooklyn apartment to taste some new seasonal creations and capture a few photos for her growing online portfolio. But first, she needed to make a trip to the McCarren Park farmers market to gather the perfect ingredients.
Unfortunately, Emma was also unprepared and headed to the farmers market for inspiration and ingredients. She figured she'd stop by the McCarren farmer's market first. It was small, but that also meant it was intimate. She didn't “know, know” the regular vendors, but they recognized each other and knew what she liked. Their recommendations would definitely help her start to narrow down the options.

It was early on a Sunday, so, unsurprisingly, the streets were empty. Williamsburg stayed up late on Saturday and its denizens weren't going to start hunting for coffee until at least 10 am. The strollers were out, because kids never sleep, but even they seemed to be lighter than usual. With fall finally arriving, maybe everyone was busy rearranging their closets.

As Emma approached the familiar market, the sights and smells of autumn filled her senses. Rows of stalls overflowed with ripe produce - glistening squash, earthy root vegetables, and vibrant greens. The air was thick with the aroma of freshly baked bread and the smoky char of grilled sausages. Emma inhaled deeply, feeling a sense of excitement and comfort wash over her.
She knew most of the regular vendors by name, and they in turn recognized her. The market was a close-knit community, and Emma took pride in supporting the local farmers and artisans. This morning, she had a specific mission in mind - to track down her favorite hot sauce vendor, Hank, and see what new and interesting flavors he had to offer.
She'd walked slowly, so it took Emma about fifteen minutes to get to the farmers market. She'd started to get cold and one of the vendors had one of those big coffee holders that you'd see at a church, or maybe at a meeting at a church. You know, those big, pump top, insulated liquid dispensers? One of those.

“Do you have nut milk?” she asked.

“Pressed it myself!” the vendor said, much more agreeably than she expected.

She didn't have an issue with dairy, but that bistro really overdid the cream in everything that she'd grown weary of it. “Could I get a coffee with a splash of whatever nut milk you've got?”

He inputted her order on his phone, handed her a card reader — one of those tap to pay one's from Square — and prepared the coffee. She paid, pulled out a few dollars from her wallet, and put them in his tip jar. It was an unusually large tip and the vendor's face showed it.

“Ben,” he said, handing Emma the coffee with his left hand and extending his right for a handshake.

“Emma.”

“I'm usually on the Upper West, but there was an open table here this week and I figured I'd see how my but milks sold here. Let me know what you think!”

Emma smiled and scanned the rest of the stands. She recognized a few people from “the industry” shopping, but not by name. Good thing she got up early, the best ingredients would be picked over within the hour.

Lots of squash, potatoes, and cabbage. She could do some traditional autumn dishes, but is that really going to grab anyone's attention? She walked through the middle, looking left and right at every stand. Her favorite hot sauce vendor was always here, except today it seemed. Looking at all the hearty produce, Emma immediately thought about spicing things up with his homemade hot sauce based on a “secret family recipe” that he swore he'd take to his grave, always putting on a Shakespearean performance for anyone who asked for the recipe.
Alas, tonight's menu would be very classically fall.
Hank's stall was a must-visit for Emma whenever she stopped by. He always greeted her with a warm smile and a theatrical pitch for his "secret family recipe" hot sauce. Emma loved the way he brought the simple condiment to life with his animated storytelling. She imagined using his spicy elixir to liven up tonight's autumnal menu.
But as Emma scanned the rows of vendors, Hank's familiar setup was nowhere to be seen. Furrowing her brow, she approached one of the other regular sellers, an older woman with a kind face who ran a preserve stall.
"Excuse me, do you happen to know what happened to Hank? He's usually set up right over there," Emma said, gesturing to the empty space.
The woman's expression turned somber. "Oh, you mean Hank? Yeah, he was here last Saturday, but he looked a bit off. Then on Wednesday, we learned he had given up his stall with no notice. Didn't say a word to any of us. Very strange."
Emma thanked the woman and continued walking, discreetly inquiring with a few other vendors. But no one seemed to know what had become of the charismatic hot sauce maker. A growing sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach.
As Emma made her way home, the missing vendor weighed heavily on her mind. She couldn't understand why Hank would abandon his regular spot without warning. Had something happened to him? Was he simply taking a break? The uncertainty gnawed at her.
Reaching her apartment, Emma set down her reusable shopping bags and began unpacking the seasonal bounty she had acquired. Squash, potatoes, leafy greens - the makings of a comforting fall feast. But the absence of Hank's signature hot sauce cast a pall over her culinary plans.
Emma paused, spatula in hand, as a thought occurred to her. Her focus on Hank was a welcome distraction for her own mind, which she wouldn’t say was particularly at ease since she made such significant changes to her own life. The idea of Hank having something to overcome was a far more pleasant thought than her own challenges ahead.
Pushing the lingering thoughts of Hank to the back of her mind, Emma resumed her cooking, determined to deliver an unforgettable autumnal spread for her guests. As the savory scents of roasted squash and simmering sausage filled the air, her spirits lifted. Tonight would be a chance to reconnect with the people she cared about most, to savor good food and conversation. Whatever had happened to Hank, it would have to wait.
But little did Emma know, the mystery of the missing hot sauce vendor was about to become the catalyst for an adventure that would bring her and her friends closer than ever before.
