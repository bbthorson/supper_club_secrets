### Chapter Two - The First Supper
The door buzzed, a harsh, electric sound that cut through the sizzle of onions in the pan. Emma tasted the contents of her ladle, set it down, and quickly shuffled to the intercom.

“Jasper!”

“Ems! You sound surprised! Didn’t think I’d come?” the voice on the other end crackled, laced with a smile she could hear even through the cheap speaker.

“Nah,” she said, pressing the button to unlock the lobby door. “Just didn’t expect YOU to be first.”

A minute later, he was at her door, a bottle of red wine in hand, his grin giving off the distinct energy of a golden retriever. “Well, if I'm being honest, I still haven't reset my clocks for daylight savings and I got my times mixed up…” Jasper trailed off as Emma, already having turned back to the kitchen, shot him a look over her shoulder.

“Daylight savings is next month, you bozo. Also, you were literally looking at your phone when I opened the door. You could just say you made an effort to be here on time,” Emma said, her attention back on the stove.

Jasper, unfazed, began digging around in a drawer for a corkscrew.

“Two drawers to the left. Like literally always,” Emma said without looking, the words a familiar refrain in the long-running play of their friendship.

Jasper located the corkscrew and finally responded, “I wouldn’t want to lie to you.”

She glanced at him, they both smiled, and she rolled her eyes, the gesture as comfortable and practiced as a sigh.

The door buzzed again. Jasper, in the middle of twisting the corkscrew into the wine bottle, called out, “Can you get that?” in a sarcastic, mocking voice, already on his way to the door. He pulled it wide open, and with a final, dramatic tug, freed the cork with a satisfying pop.

“WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS,” Jasper announced to the hallway with his trademark smirk.

“Olivia?” Emma called from the kitchen.

“And Oliver and Noah,” Olivia’s cheerful voice called back as the trio stepped inside.

“Welcome, welcome,” Jasper continued, playing the role of host. “I’ve just opened a very exclusive vintage that needs a bit of time to open up. Can I get you anything else to drink while we wait?”

“Liv, I’ve got some deviled eggs in the fridge. Can you take them out and sprinkle some paprika on them?” Emma called out, cutting through Jasper’s performance.

“On it!” Olivia said, brushing past Jasper to help Emma in the kitchen, a silent, sisterly alliance against his antics.

“Rude, but okay,” Jasper sniffed. “How ‘bout you, gents?”

“How about a glass of that $15 bottle of wine you bought because it had a fancy-looking label?” Noah said dryly, already taking off his jacket.

“Ah! You know me all too well!” Jasper went into the now-crowded kitchen in search of wine glasses. Emma, having lived this exact series of events enough times to know he was coming, proactively shouted the location of the wine glasses that Jasper had retrieved so many times before.

Jasper poured the wine, handing out the glasses. Olivia, doing a quick count, asked, “What about Elijah?”

Before Jasper could say something sarcastic, Oliver jumped in. “He had a report to file before the end of the day. Said he’d head over as soon as that was done.”

“And you’re just telling me now? Also, it’s Sunday!” Olivia retorted.

“Yeah, guy never stops working,” Noah chimed in. “He needs to find work-life balance. He’s too caught up in that hustle culture; it’s gonna catch up with him.”

Not wanting to hear Jasper and Noah argue about hustle culture, Olivia changed the subject. “A toast!” she exclaimed, holding her half-full glass of wine aloft and staring pointedly at Oliver to follow suit. He raised his glass, then looked at Jasper and Noah, nodding for them to do the same.

“To Ems!” Olivia said, pushing her glass higher.

The men responded in unison with a mix of names for their host, a messy, affectionate chorus. “To Emma!” “To Ems!” “To Mama E!”

Emma turned around, a genuine smile on her face. “Thanks, guys, but seriously, I don’t need any of that. Just relax and enjoy some deviled eggs with your very exclusive vintage.” She winked at Jasper, who winked back.

The guests gathered in the living room, a space furnished with an eclectic mix of hand-me-downs and street finds. Emma continued with dinner, occasionally bringing a tasting spoon into the living room to let her friends try her work. The guests caught up, sharing stories of work, bad dates, and the news, though whenever they circled back to the news, they inevitably agreed to change the topic.

They’d long since finished Jasper’s wine, and Noah was eager for everyone to sample his next offering. It was from a sustainable vineyard in the Finger Lakes that grew organic, sulfur-free wines. Eventually, Jasper interrupted to let Noah know that they didn’t care.

Oliver added in the background that most new wine-growing regions are the result of tax policy, not changing weather patterns, but he was sure nobody heard him. At least one person did. Olivia looked over and mouthed “thank you, babe” while Jasper and Noah were fake fighting.

Olivia, tired of their typical banter, interrupted with a loud call to the chef, “Everything alright in there?”

“Yeah, first dish should be out in ten,” Emma chirped back.

“No, I just mean… you aren’t really you today. Everything okay? I know life’s been a bit… messy lately,” Olivia said. The men quieted down, having wanted to ask a similar question but not feeling confident enough to.

Their entire time in New York, Emma had worked in kitchens. Inconvenient hours, difficult shifts—they knew it weighed on her, but they were all pretty shocked when she told them she’d quit two weeks ago. After all, it’s New York City. You don’t just not have a job.

“Don’t worry about it,” Emma responded, turning back to the stove. “The kitchen just needs lookin’ at.” The sudden shift into her blunt, Western Pennsylvania dialect was a clear sign to her closest friends that she wasn't fine at all.

“Yeah?” Olivia responded softly, trying to leave space for Emma to continue.

“Honestly!”

“Honestly, it sounds like you’re, I don’t know, kind of stressed,” Jasper interjected. “You know I’ve got you if you need. Just, like, let me know.”

Emma lowered the burner and turned around. “It’s just that,” she paused and refilled her wine, smelling it, taking a sip, and then putting it down with a wrinkled nose. “It’s just that I had something else planned for you tonight. Not planned, but an idea.” She picked up the wine and had another sip. “Honestly, Noah, you need to start Googling shit before you buy it.”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” he started, but Olivia interrupted.

“What’s up, Ems?”

“Honestly, you’re going to think I’m crazy.”

“Duh,” Jasper interjected quickly, sensing tension and wanting to diffuse it, unhelpfully. Olivia and Emma looked at him and both rolled their eyes in unison.

“I didn't want to make you something basic, so I got fixated on this guy's hot sauce. It's not that different from any other hot sauce, I mean, it's really good, but he tells such a great story about it and I love to retell the story when I use it. He gets all theatrical, you know? And he swears the secret is this crazy pepper his great-great-grandmother brought up from Philly, calls it a 'Fish Pepper' or something, says it's the only thing that gives it that... zing. I feel like the story gives soul to what I'm making, and I wanted to do something, I don't know, a little out there for you tonight, but still ground it in that story.”

“That’s really cool, Ems,” Oliver chimed in.

“Yeah, thanks. Anyway, I went to the farmer’s market where I always see this guy. He wasn’t there,” she paused, feeling if that would be bigger news, but her friends were just staring back blankly. She went to sip her glass of wine again but had a visceral reaction and threw it in the sink. “Can I choose the next wine?”

“YES!” Everyone but Noah responded in unison.
