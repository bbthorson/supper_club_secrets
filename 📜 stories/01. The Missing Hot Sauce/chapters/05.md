### Chapter 5 - Spicing Up The Search
Jasper stood up, showing a beaming smile of purple teeth, “Elijah, are you saying you WANT to hang out with us two weeks in a row?” He paused for dramatic effect while each member of the group silently wondered what he’d do next. Before Elijah could respond, he added “WHAT IF we do this dinner thing again, except next week we all bring a dish that helps justify your theory?”

Noah scoffed, “Okay Mister Russian Aliens working for the CIA.”

“Seriously! I kind of like hanging out with you guys sometimes. Maybe we should give it another go,” Jasper responded endearingly, but with his expected sarcasm.

The group groaned in unison, but their disappointment was quickly replaced by a renewed sense of excitement. A real-life mystery to solve? This was even better than their tipsy theorizing. 

Emma stood up. “I’m in. I miss Hank. Can’t hurt asking around a little more. But can somebody else handle the entree? I don’t want to be selfish, but I’m not sure I’ve got the energy to do everything.”

Jasper's eyes lit up. "Let's draw numbers again! We need some level of chaos." He grabbed the hat Elijah had used and collected the numbers from drawn for their conspiracy ordering.

Olivia, ever the planner, chimed in before anyone could reach for a number. "Hold on, Jasper. Oliver and I will handle the entree. It's the most work, and there are two of us." She shot a playful glance at her husband, who merely nodded in agreement.

“I'll get extra creative with ingredients from all the local shops. There's bound to be some neighborhood gossip,” Olivia said confidently. 

“I'll see what kind of permits farmer's markets have to file,” Oliver added.

“You can't eat city permits,” Jasper said impatiently. He shook the hat in his hand and shared his rules, “here's what the numbers stand for: One - wine, the most important ingredient to any supper club.”

“Supper club?” Elijah interrupted. 

“Yeah, supper club! What else do you call best friends getting together for dinner?” continued Jasper.

“Dinner.” It took a few hours, but Oliver was finding his confidence to be a little sassy. Olivia smiled at him again. 

“NUMBER TWO,” Jasper pushed forward, “is the appetizer course. Canapés, hors d’oeuvres, an amuse-bouche! Whet our appetites.” He put one foot on his chair, growing in confidence unnecessarily for his course listing. “Three - our second course.”

“That doesn't make sense,” Elijah piped up.

“Well wine is most important,” Jasper smiled to show his purple teeth, “so second course is number three. We need our fiber, our vegetables, who knows what Olivia is going to make. That also means four is the entree and it's off the table.”

Elijah interrupted again, “Jasper, you know this hardly makes sense, right? We could all just decide what we want to bring.”

“FIVE,” Jasper wouldn't be silenced, now standing on his folding chair with questionable balance. “Five is dessert. Last in the order, but the biggest number because it's the best course. I'd eat it first if I could.”

Elijah reached his hand towards the hat Jasper had been waving around like a maestros wand. “Are you done yet? Get down and let's draw numbers.” Jasper stepped down and extended the hat to Elijah. He reached in and drew a number, “three, you know, for the second course,” he said.

“You know I love you bud, but can you please not make a quinoa salad with a bunch of raw vegetable?” Noah asked, his voice peaking more than usual at the end, as if he was touching a third rail.

“Why do you say that?” Elijah said looking around the room. Nobody responded, speaking volumes.

Jasper, wanting to move on from the lightly awkward tension, tapped Emma on the head with the hat. Already content with not having to contribute the entree, she reached in, took out a number and said “I got dessert. I'll head to some specialty stores and find some fun ingredients. Should be perfect to implicate Big Hot Sauce.”  A small smile played on her lips as she imagined whipping up a simple yet decadent treat.

Noah didn't wait for Jasper. He reached in to the hat and snatched out a number. “One.”

“Oh God,” Emma accidentally blurted out.

“What!?” Noah snapped back.

“C’mon, Noah. I wasn't even here to sample your wine choice and I know it sucked,” Elijah added in Emma's defense. 

Noah looked a little annoyed, but didn't want to deal with it. “You wanna get the wine, Jasper?” he said.

“Hell yeah. I needed to talk to the wine merchant down the block about Russian CIA aliens anyway.”

“Okay, but are we, like, actually taking this seriously?” Noah asked, ever the pragmatist. “Or is this just an excuse to drink more of Jasper’s fancy-label wine?”

Jasper, who had been making his way to the door, spun around with a wounded expression. “Hey! I’ll have you know the wine merchant and I are on a first-name basis. And for the record, I am taking this very seriously.” He puffed out his chest. “In fact, I’ll probably have this whole thing solved by Tuesday. I know people. Very important people.”

Olivia rolled her eyes, a smile playing on her lips. “Of course you do, dear. Just try not to get us all arrested before the appetizers are served next week, okay?”

“It’s settled then,” Elijah said, looking around at his funny group of friends, his Brooklyn family. “We’re all meeting here next week, dish in hand, with our definitive research as to what happened to Hank.”

He raised his glass. As they clinked their glasses together, a shared sense of purpose filled the room. The hot sauce vendor might be missing, but the adventure was just coming into view.
