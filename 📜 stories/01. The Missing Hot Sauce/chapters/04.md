### Chapter 4 - Stirring the Pot
#### OLIVER
Oliver stood up from the love seat and composed himself. 

Elijah interrupted, “stand in the kitchen,” and pointed. He stood up and turned off the living room lights to set the stage.

Oliver went to the kitchen, shoulders slumped. “You got this,” yelled Olivia.

“I don't want to do this,” started Oliver.

“But you have to,” prodded Elijah, feeling the red wine start to take effect. 

“I think the hot sauce guy is probably on vacation.”

“Boo!” Noah yelled. 

“I think the hot sauce guy is probably on vacation, but if he isn't I think his hot sauce got really popular online and he was drawn to a lower tax state.”

“Except I already texted that shop owner and got the name of his hot sauce and it's not for sale anywhere online.” Olivia was clearly tired of Oliver not cooperating. 

“And I think when he was moving, he took the hot sauce website down because he had a business partner and the business partner caught wind and kidnapped him.”

“Definitely killed him,” added Jasper.

“Jesus, Jasper, we agreed, no death,” Noah said.

“Anyway, he's been kidnapped and his business partner wants money. Is that good enough?”

“Very intriguing, Oliver. I'll have to take this prediction into consideration. Who's next?” Elijah said, relieving Oliver of any more unwanted attention.

#### EMMA
Emma was already on her way to the kitchen when Oliver finished. She hugged him and whispered nice thoughts in his ear before lightly pushing him back to the living room.

“While Oliver has dreamt up a very believable fiction, it is still that!” Emma opened, adding “Fiction!” after a pause that was just too long to ruin the dramatic effect. “Unlike Oliver, I know what really happened to Hottie McHot Sauce.”

“Wait, did you only care about this guy cuz he's hot?” Noah interrupted.

“What? No. He's not hot. I mean, he's not not hot. He's, like, Boaty McBoatface…” Emma rebutted. The room was losing focus. “Hey! I know what happened.” She paused. “It was Big Hot Sauce.”

“Oh shit! Big Hot Sauce in the house!” Jasper yelled in support. “Pew, Pew, Pew!”

"Big Hot Sauce," Emma declared, her voice rising with each word. "They saw Hank's artisanal, small-batch hot sauce as a rising threat. They knew his secret family recipe was too good, too authentic, too real. So they did what they always do – they crushed him. Bought him out, silenced him, maybe even... disappeared him." She paused dramatically, eyes wide. "Think about it. Have you seen Hank since last week? Exactly."

“Well, to be honest, literally none of us have ever seen Hank, so no.” Oliver uncharacteristically interjected. He smirked and saw Olivia smiling at him out of the corner of his eye.

“You know what I mean, Ollie!” Emma said resting her case. “Elijah knows I’m right. He’ll see the truth.”

#### OLIVIA
Olivia stood up from her love seat and smoothed her skirt, “It looks like I’m next, and I’ll tell you it’s quite simple.”

She ​​was the picture of composure as her eyes slowly went across the room, stopping to make just enough eye contact with everyone.  "Oh, darling Emma, you're being dramatic!” she said, as if impersonating Marilyn Monroe.

“It's far more likely Hank's been swept off his feet by some wealthy socialite. You know, the type who summers in the Hamptons and has a personal shopper at Bergdorf's. She probably whisked him away on her private jet to a secluded villa where they're sipping champagne and feeding each other caviar." 

She clasped her hands together, a dreamy smile on her face. "Honestly, I'd do the same if I had the chance!" After a brief pause where nobody responded, she continued, “I’m kidding! I’ve got Oliver to take care of me. What else could a girl dream of?”

“Okay, Olivia, that did NOT happen,” Jasper said, trying to sideline her before his turn.

“Sure, Jasper. I can’t wait to hear what you have cooked up…” she said, eyes rolling.
#### JASPER
Jasper sprung from his chair, knocking over his wine glass in his excitement. "Aliens!" he exclaimed, his voice echoing through the apartment.

Emma also sprung up, rushing to the kitchen to get paper towels. Elijah reached over and picked up the wine glass, though the chaos did nothing to slow Jasper down.

"Hank's hot sauce was too hot. It was like a beacon, drawing in extraterrestrial beings from across the galaxy!" He paced back and forth, gesticulating wildly. 

"They landed their spaceship in McCarren Park under the cover of darkness, snatched Hank right from his stall, and now they're probing him for his spicy secrets!"

He looked around the room, disappointed to not get more reactions. He was all too predictable. Noah made a yawning gesture and put his head onto Elijah’s shoulder.

Jasper threw his hands up in the air. "Or maybe it was the CIA. Or the Russians. Or maybe... maybe it was all of them working together!" He collapsed back into his chair, breathless but grinning. His shock and awe strategy hadn’t worked, but he was pleased with himself nonetheless.

“You done?” asked Noah.

“I don’t know, am I?” Jasper retorted sassily.  “Can’t wait to hear your dumb idea.”
#### NOAH
Noah leaned back, arms crossed, a smug look on his face. "You guys are all missing the big picture," he said, his voice dripping with confidence. "It's the CIA, plain and simple. They're trying to destabilize the global pepper market. They know Hank's hot sauce is the key to controlling the world's spice supply." He ticked off points on his fingers. "Step one: eliminate Hank. Step two: create a hot sauce shortage. Step three: watch the price of peppers skyrocket. Step four: profit." He smirked. "It's all part of their master plan for world domination."

Jasper snorted. "Oh, please, Noah. The CIA has better things to do than mess with some hot sauce vendor. Besides, everyone knows the real power lies with the Illuminati lizard people."

Noah rolled his eyes. "Lizard people? Seriously, Jasper? You're the one who believes in aliens."

"Hey, at least my theory is more fun than yours," Jasper retorted, grinning. "And who's to say the lizard people aren't working with the aliens? It's all connected, man."

Noah just shook his head, a bemused smile playing on his lips. "Whatever you say, Jasper. Just don't be surprised when the CIA comes knocking on your door."

#### ELIJAH
"They're all too good! Too good!" Elijah said through laughs as Jasper and Noah continued to verbally jab each other. "I gotta be honest, I don't think I can pick!"

A chorus of protests erupted. "But you have to!" Olivia insisted, pouting playfully. "We need a verdict!"

"Yeah, E, don't be a buzzkill," Jasper chimed in, still grinning from his extraterrestrial escapade. "Pick one, any one! Or, hey, maybe Hank's hot sauce was so good it created a rift in the space-time continuum, and he's now trapped in an alternate dimension where everything is made of peppers!"

Noah scoffed. "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The CIA theory is clearly the most logical. It's all about economics, people!"

Emma nudged Elijah playfully. "Come on, E, don't listen to these two. Big Hot Sauce is the real culprit. It's a classic tale of corporate greed crushing the little guy."

Elijah raised his hands in mock surrender. "Alright, alright, you've all made compelling arguments. But I'm still not convinced. Maybe we need to do some actual investigating next week before I can make a final decision."
