### Chapter 10: The Seamless Supper
That night, the mood in Emma's apartment was funereal. The usual scent of roasting vegetables and simmering sauces was replaced by the lukewarm, greasy smell of takeout containers spread across the coffee table. The group picked at their food under a heavy blanket of silence.

It was Emma who finally broke it, her voice small and brittle. "He knows," she said, pushing a container of pad thai away. "He knows about my OnlyFans."

She explained everythingâ€”the man at the door, the legal threats, the handwritten note. As she spoke, she braced herself for judgment, for the shock and disappointment of her friends.

Instead, she was met with a wave of immediate, fierce loyalty.

"That son of a bitch," Olivia said, her voice tight with anger.

"He's trying to intimidate you," Elijah added, his usual analytical calm replaced by a cold fury. "It's a classic scare tactic."

"But how?" Noah asked, the question hanging in the air. "How could he possibly know any of that? How did he even know to come after you, specifically?"

The paranoia was instant and suffocating. They started retracing their steps, their triumphant discoveries from the week before now feeling like a series of catastrophic mistakes.

"The cheesemonger?" Emma suggested. "Could she have said something?"

"My source at the boutique?" Olivia offered. "No, Marcus is discreet."

"The city database is anonymous," Oliver said, shaking his head. "There's no way to track my searches."

"The patents are public record," Noah added. "It can't be that."

The silence returned, heavier this time, thick with suspicion and fear. They looked at each other, the trust between them strained for the first time. The mogul hadn't just threatened Emma; he had driven a wedge of doubt into the heart of their group.

It was Jasper who finally broke. He had been staring at his uneaten food, his face pale, his usual chaotic energy completely gone.

"It was me," he whispered.

Everyone turned to him.

"What?" Elijah said, his voice sharp.

"My friend," Jasper said, his voice cracking. He wouldn't look at any of them. "Brenda. In real estate. I told her everything. The whole story. I thought... I thought I was helping." He finally looked up, his eyes swimming with guilt. "Her firm does business with that mogul. She must have told him. I'm so sorry, Ems. I'm so, so sorry."

The confession hung in the air, devastating in its simplicity. It wasn't a sophisticated hack or a corporate spy. It was just Jasper, trying to be the hero, accidentally lighting the fuse.
