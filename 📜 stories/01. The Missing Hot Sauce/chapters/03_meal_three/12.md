### Chapter Twelve: The Seamless Supper
"Hey, you!" Olivia's voice was a bright, cheerful burst through the phone. "I was just thinking about you. Marcus at The Gilded Fern asked if we'd cracked the case yet. The whole neighborhood is talking."

"Liv," Emma choked out, her voice a raw whisper. "Something's happened."

The cheer in Olivia's voice vanished, replaced by a cold, sharp focus. "What is it? What's wrong?"

Through a torrent of panicked sobs, Emma explained everything—the man at the door, the legal threats, the handwritten note.

Olivia listened without interrupting, her silence a steady, grounding presence. When Emma was finished, her first words weren't of fear, but of pure, unadulterated rage.

"That son of a bitch," she hissed, her voice tight with fury. "That cowardly little man." She took a deep breath. "Listen to me, Ems. This is what they do. I've had cease and desists from competitors for my candle line. They're just trying to scare you. It's a bully tactic because they know they're in the wrong."

"But he knows, Liv," Emma whispered. "He knows about my... my account."

"He knows you're a smart, creative woman who found a way to make a living in a world that is not built for us," Olivia shot back, her voice fierce and protective. "That's all he knows. And we are not going to let him use it against you." She paused, the sound of her typing quickly in the background. "Okay. I'm starting a group text. Everyone, your place, tonight. This is a five-alarm fire."

"But it's a Wednesday," Emma said weakly. "Elijah's probably working, Noah has his coding thing..."

"I don't care," Olivia said, her voice leaving no room for argument. "They'll get here when they get here. I'm on my way."

The line went dead. Emma stood in the silence, the phone still pressed to her ear. For the first time since the knock, she felt a tiny, fragile flicker of hope. She wasn't alone. The cavalry was coming.

An hour later, the mood in Emma's apartment was funereal. Olivia had arrived first, enveloping Emma in a fierce hug before immediately taking charge, her usual bubbly energy replaced by a grim, protective efficiency. Oliver and Noah had arrived together soon after, their faces etched with a shared, anxious concern.

The legal document sat on the coffee table, a toxic centerpiece in the middle of the room. They had all read it. They had all seen the handwritten note. Now, they were sitting in a heavy, suffocating silence, the sheer, paralyzing reality of the situation sinking in.

"We should eat," Olivia said finally, breaking the silence. "We need to eat."

It was a simple, practical suggestion, but it immediately devolved into a low-grade, stress-fueled chaos.

"What are we in the mood for?" Oliver asked, already scrolling through a delivery app on his phone.

"I don't care," Emma mumbled from the couch, where she was wrapped in a blanket.

"Okay, but we have to pick something," Noah said, seeing not a human crisis, but a logistical problem that needed to be solved. "The optimal solution is to find a single cuisine that satisfies the dietary restrictions and preferences of at least eighty percent of the group."

"It's not a math problem, Noah," Olivia snapped, her patience already worn thin.

"Fine," Noah conceded, shifting to a new tactic. "Let's just get pizza. Pizza has a ninety-four percent satisfaction rating across all demographics."

"Absolutely not," Jasper said, having just arrived and taken in the scene. "We are never, ever, doing a group pizza order again. Not after the 2nd Avenue Pizza Debacle."

A flicker of a shared, traumatic memory passed between him and Noah. Olivia shuddered. "He's right. I think I'm still finding pepperoni in my coat pockets."

The door buzzed. It was Elijah. He stepped into the apartment, his eyes immediately landing on the document on the table. He didn't need to ask what had happened. He picked it up, his face a mask of cold, analytical fury as he read.

"This is toothless," he said finally, his voice dangerously quiet. "It's a scare tactic. An expensive, well-drafted scare tactic, but legally, it's meaningless."

"Tell that to the part about my OnlyFans," Emma said, her voice muffled by the blanket.

Jasper, who had missed the initial explanation, looked confused. "Your what?"

Emma finally sat up, pulling the blanket tight around her shoulders. She took a deep, shaky breath and confessed. She told them everything, the words tumbling out in a rush of shame and defiance. She explained how, after she'd quit her job, the freelance checks weren't enough to cover her rent. She told them how she'd noticed weird, but harmless, comments on her Instagram cooking videos—strangers obsessing over her hands as she kneaded dough, or her bare feet on the kitchen floor.

"So, I just... I made it a thing," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "It's called 'Kinky Kitchen.' It's not... I'm not naked or doing anything sexual. I just... I cook barefoot. I make a little extra money from people who have a thing for feet, I guess. It's weird, but it's been paying the bills."

She braced herself for the reaction. For the judgment, the awkward silence.

"So what?" Olivia said immediately, her voice fierce. "It's your body, it's your kitchen. If some weirdo wants to pay you to watch you make pasta, that's their problem, not yours."

"Doesn't matter if you were naked," Jasper chimed in, surprisingly earnest. "It's still your business."

Elijah, who had been silent, finally spoke. He looked at Emma, and there was no judgment in his eyes. Only a quiet, surprising flicker of respect. "You found a market inefficiency and monetized it," he said, his voice a low murmur. "That's just good business." He was surprised, yes. The idea of the sweet, slightly naive Emma running a secret foot-fetish cooking channel was a data point he never would have predicted. But in his world, financial independence was the ultimate goal, and he respected the hustle, no matter how strange its form.
