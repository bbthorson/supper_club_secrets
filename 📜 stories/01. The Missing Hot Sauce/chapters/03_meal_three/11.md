### Chapter 11: The Counter-Attack
For a long moment, the only sound was the hum of the refrigerator. The anger in the room, once directed at the mogul, now had a new, closer target. Noah looked at Jasper with pure, unadulterated fury. Olivia's face was a mask of disbelief.

But it was Emma who spoke first. She looked at Jasper's miserable face, and in that moment, her fear was eclipsed by a surge of something else: defiant anger.

"No," she said, her voice steady and clear. "You made a mistake. But he's the one who's a monster." She stood up, a new resolve hardening her expression. "He thinks he can scare me into silence? He thinks he can use my life against me and I'll just crawl away? No. We're not running. We're fighting back."

The shift in energy was immediate. The cloud of defeat began to dissipate, replaced by the hot, sharp focus of a shared purpose.

"She's right," Elijah said, his voice low and intense. "He's overplayed his hand. He thinks we're just a bunch of kids playing detective. Let's show him what we can do."

The half-eaten takeout was pushed aside. Noah's laptop was opened, this time not for a casual search, but for strategic planning. The mood was no longer somber or paranoid; it was the tense, electric hum of a war room.

"Okay," Noah said, cracking his knuckles. "A direct attack is useless. He'll bury it. We need an asymmetric approach. We can't make one big splash; we need to create a thousand ripples."

"Influencers," Emma said immediately. "I have a list of food bloggers and journalists. Some are small, some are big. If they all start asking questions at the same time..."

"And I have the neighborhood," Olivia added, her eyes bright. "The shop owners, the community board members. They can't ignore a local groundswell."

"I can build a digital ghost," Noah said, his voice gaining confidence. "Anonymous accounts, temporary domains, untraceable email chains to feed them the information. By the time he tries to track the source, it'll be gone."

"I'll write the brief," Elijah said, already pulling out his phone. "A clean, professional summary of the facts. The LLC, the patents, the timeline. No speculation. Just the data. It'll be irrefutable."

Oliver, who had been silent, finally spoke. "And I can cross-reference the mogul's other properties against vendor contracts. There might be a pattern of this behavior. More evidence for the pile."

They looked at each other, a team forged in crisis. They had a plan. It was audacious, it was risky, and it was their only shot.
