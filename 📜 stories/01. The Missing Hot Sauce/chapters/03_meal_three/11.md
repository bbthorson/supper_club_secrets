## Part 3
### Chapter Eleven: Service for One
The week after their triumphant dinner was a quiet one. The group exchanged a few excited texts, a digital flurry of "we did it!" and "what's next?", but mostly they were waiting, basking in the secret knowledge of what they had uncovered. The feeling of victory was a warm, pleasant hum beneath the surface of their daily routines.

On Wednesday afternoon, the hum was abruptly silenced.

Emma was in her kitchen, testing a new scone recipe, her hands covered in a light dusting of flour. The afternoon sun streamed through the window, illuminating the motes of flour dancing in the air. It was a peaceful, domestic scene, a world away from corporate espionage and missing persons. That was when the knock came.

It wasn't the familiar buzz from the intercom, but a sharp, authoritative rap directly on her apartment door. It was the kind of knock that meant business, not friendship. She frowned, wiping her hands on her apron as she walked to the door.

She peered through the peephole. A man in a cheap, ill-fitting suit stood in the hallway, holding a large manila envelope. He looked bored and impatient, a man for whom this was just another stop on a long, tedious list.

Emma opened the door a crack, keeping the chain on. "Can I help you?"

"Emma [Last Name]?" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any emotion.

"Yes?"

He didn't say another word, simply thrust the envelope through the gap in the door. "You've been served," he mumbled, before turning and walking briskly down the hall without a backward glance, his footsteps echoing in the sudden silence.

Emma closed the door, her heart beginning to pound against her ribs. She stared at the envelope. Her name and address were typed neatly on the front. In the top left corner was the embossed logo of a high-powered law firm she recognized from the masthead of the city's most expensive newspaper.

With trembling fingers, she tore it open. The document inside was thick with dense, impenetrable legalese, but a few phrases leaped out at her in stark, terrifying clarity:

CEASE AND DESIST...

DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER...

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE...

And then, on the final page, a single, handwritten note on a separate slip of paper, attached with a paperclip. It wasn't from the lawyers. The handwriting was sharp, angry, and distinctly personal.

We know all your secrets. Kinky Kitchen, isn't it?

The scone dough on the counter was forgotten. The warmth of victory from Sunday night had turned to ice in her stomach. They didn't just know about the investigation. They knew about her.

For a long moment, she just stood there, frozen in the middle of her kitchen. The legal document felt impossibly heavy in her hand, the slip of paper with its spiky handwriting seeming to burn her fingertips. The world narrowed to the four corners of that note. Her secret, the one she had so carefully guarded, the one that paid her rent and kept her afloat, was no longer hers. It was a weapon, and it was pointed directly at her.

Her first instinct was a desperate, primal urge for order, for logic. Elijah. He would know what this meant. He lived in a world of contracts and consequences; he could translate this terrifying document into something manageable, something they could fight. Her hand, shaking, fumbled for her phone on the counter. She stabbed at his contact, her breath held tight in her chest.

It went straight to voicemail. "You've reached Elijah," his smooth, professional voice said. "Please leave a message."

A wave of pure, undiluted panic washed over her. The one person who could make sense of this was unreachable. She was alone.

No. Not alone. Her thumb scrolled frantically through her contacts, past Jasper, past Noah, past Oliver. She needed someone who would understand not just the legal threat, but the violation. The chilling, specific fear of being a woman who had been watched, who had been found. Her finger landed on the name. Olivia. She pressed call, her knuckles white as she held the phone to her ear, listening to the ring, praying she would pick up.
