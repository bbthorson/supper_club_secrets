### Chapter Thirteen: A Bitter Taste
The initial wave of support was a balm to Emmaâ€™s frayed nerves, but it couldn't hold back the tide of fear that began to creep back into the room. The reality of their situation settled in, cold and heavy.

"It's fucked up," Olivia said, her voice low and angry. "It's completely fucked up that he can just do this."

"But he can," Elijah said, his voice flat and devoid of emotion. "This is what they do. This is what people with this kind of money and power always do. They don't have to win in court. They just have to make the fight so expensive and so miserable that you give up. We are not equipped for this. This is how people lose their apartments. This is how people go bankrupt. We have to stop."

His words, pragmatic and brutal, hung in the air. He was right. They all knew it. The triumphant energy of their last dinner felt like a distant, naive memory. They were no longer detectives; they were just a group of friends who had flown too close to the sun.

It was Noah who broke the heavy silence, his voice laced with a new, unsettling thought. "But how did they even know?" he asked, looking around the room. "How did they know to target Emma? How did they know about her... account? I did a full data sweep. I couldn't find anything." He looked genuinely perplexed, his faith in the omniscience of a simple search query shaken. "It's like they knew exactly where to look."

An awkward, charged silence descended on the group. Noah was the tech guy. He was the one who lived and breathed the digital world. If anyone could find a secret, it was him. The unspoken question hung in the air, heavy and poisonous.

"What?" Noah said, his head snapping up as he read their faces. "You think I did this? You think I was, what, tracking you?" He looked genuinely hurt, his usual pedantic confidence crumbling. "I would never."

"We know, Noah," Olivia said quickly, trying to smooth over the sudden rift. "Of course you wouldn't."

"Then how?" he pressed, his voice rising. "Someone had to have told them. Someone had to have talked."

Every eye in the room slowly, inevitably, turned to Jasper.

He had been staring at his uneaten food, his face pale, his usual chaotic energy completely gone. He looked up, and in that moment, they all knew.

"It was me," he whispered.

"What?" Elijah said, his voice sharp.

"My friend," Jasper said, his voice cracking. He wouldn't look at any of them. "Brenda. In real estate. I told her everything. The whole story. I thought... I thought I was helping."

"You told her about Emma's account?" Olivia asked, her voice a mix of disbelief and horror.

"No! God, no," Jasper said, finally looking up, his eyes swimming with guilt. "I didn't know about that. I just... I told her about us. About the investigation. I gave her Emma's name as the one who was, you know, leading the charge." He slumped back in his chair, the weight of his mistake crushing him. "Her firm does business with that mogul. She must have told him. I'm so sorry, Ems. I'm so, so sorry."

The confession hung in the air, devastating in its simplicity. It wasn't a sophisticated hack or a corporate spy. It was just Jasper, trying to be the hero, accidentally lighting the fuse.

"You idiot," Noah breathed, the words a quiet, venomous hiss.

"I was trying to help!" Jasper shot back, a flash of his old defensiveness returning. "I was the only one who got a real lead!"

"A real lead that led them right to our door!"

The argument escalated, a messy, painful explosion of fear and blame. But it was Oliver, who had been silent through the entire ordeal, who finally brought it to a halt.

"Stop," he said. His voice wasn't loud, but it cut through the anger with a surprising authority. Everyone turned to look at him.

"This is what he wants," Oliver said, his gaze steady. "He wants us to be scared. He wants us to turn on each other. Because if we do that, he wins." He looked at the legal document on the table, a flicker of something hard and unyielding in his eyes. "Elijah is right. The document is legally meaningless. It is a tool of intimidation, not law. To surrender to it is to validate the idea that the rules don't apply to the powerful. Statistically, that is a precedent we cannot accept."

He stood up, a new, unfamiliar confidence in his posture. "We are not going to be scared. We are not going to fight each other. We are going to fight him."
