### Chapter 9: The Uninvited Guest
The week after their triumphant dinner was a quiet one. The group exchanged a few excited texts, but mostly they were waiting, basking in the secret knowledge of what they had uncovered. The feeling of victory was a warm, pleasant hum beneath the surface of their daily routines.

On Wednesday afternoon, the hum was abruptly silenced.

Emma was in her kitchen, testing a new scone recipe, when a sharp, authoritative knock echoed from her apartment door. It wasn't the familiar buzz from the intercom, but a direct rap on the wood. She frowned, wiping her flour-dusted hands on her apron as she walked to the door.

She peered through the peephole. A man in a cheap, ill-fitting suit stood in the hallway, holding a large manila envelope. He looked bored and impatient.

Emma opened the door a crack. "Can I help you?"

"Emma [Last Name]?" he asked, his voice flat.

"Yes?"

He didn't say another word, simply thrust the envelope into her hands. "You've been served," he mumbled, before turning and walking briskly down the hall without a backward glance.

Emma closed the door, her heart beginning to pound against her ribs. She stared at the envelope. Her name and address were typed neatly on the front. In the top left corner was the embossed logo of a high-powered law firm she recognized from the masthead of the city's most expensive newspaper.

With trembling fingers, she tore it open. The document inside was thick with dense, impenetrable legalese, but a few phrases leaped out at her in stark, terrifying clarity:

CEASE AND DESIST...

DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER...

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE...

And then, on the final page, a single, handwritten note on a separate slip of paper, attached with a paperclip. It wasn't from the lawyers. The handwriting was sharp and angry.

We know all your secrets. Kinky Kitchen, isn't it?

The scone dough on the counter was forgotten. The warmth of victory from Sunday night had turned to ice in her stomach. They didn't just know about the investigation. They knew about her.
