### Chapter Fourteen: The Recipe for Revenge
Oliver’s words hung in the air, a sudden, sharp turning of the tide. The anger and fear in the room didn't disappear, but it began to coalesce, to harden into something new: resolve.

Jasper, his face still streaked with tears of guilt, was the first to speak. His voice, usually booming with chaotic energy, was a hoarse whisper. "He's right. We can't let them win. We have to go big. We need to make Emma a martyr."

"A what?" Emma said, looking horrified.

"A cause célèbre!" Jasper elaborated, a flicker of his old theatricality returning. "We go to the New York Times. We get you on a morning show. One brave chef against the corporate machine! It's a perfect story!"

"Absolutely not," Noah said, shaking his head. "That's a single point of failure. They'd focus all their legal firepower on one target and one media outlet. It's inefficient and insanely risky." He started pacing, his mind already building a new system. "We need to diffuse the targets. You can't kill a swarm of mosquitos with a cannonball. We don't go to one big source. We go to a hundred small ones."

"Exactly," Olivia chimed in, catching his thread immediately. "We don't go to the Times; we go to every food blogger in Brooklyn. We don't go to a morning show; we go to every neighborhood gossip page on Instagram."

The two strategies hung in the air, a perfect reflection of their proponents: Jasper's was a grand, dramatic, high-risk performance; Noah and Olivia's was a decentralized, anonymous, and persistent attack.

"The swarm is safer," Elijah said, his analytical mind weighing the probabilities. "Spreading the information across multiple, smaller platforms makes it impossible for them to squash the story with a single legal threat. It minimizes our direct exposure."

"And I don't want to be a martyr," Emma said, her voice firm. "I don't want my face on TV. I just want them to leave Hank alone."

The decision was made. They would become a swarm. The energy in the room shifted again, the paralysis of fear replaced by the focused hum of a group with a mission. Noah was already at his laptop, his fingers flying across the keyboard as he outlined a digital strategy.

"Okay," he said, his voice crackling with a newfound purpose. "I'll set up a series of anonymous email accounts and a VPN. We'll draft a core message—the facts, just the facts—and a digital press kit with all of Oliver's research and Elijah's financial model."

"I'll make a list of every local journalist, blogger, and influencer who has ever so much as mentioned a farmers market," Olivia said, pulling out her own phone.

"I can help with that," Emma offered, leaning forward. "I know the food scene. I know who the real ones are, who will actually care about this."

The group was a well-oiled machine now, each member falling into their natural role. Oliver and Elijah became the fact-checkers, ensuring every claim was backed by evidence. Noah and Olivia were the distributors, the digital and analog arms of their operation. Emma was the expert, guiding their aim.

Jasper, who had been watching the scene unfold with a mix of awe and shame, finally spoke up. "What about me?" he asked, his voice small. "What can I do?"

The group looked at him. The anger had dissipated, replaced by a quiet, reluctant understanding. He had made a terrible mistake, but he was one of them.

"We need to find Hank," Emma said softly. "The story is stronger if he's a part of it. We need to know he's okay."

It was an olive branch, and a mission. A way for him to atone.

"I can do that," Jasper said, a flicker of determination in his eyes. "I'll find him. I promise."

The delivery boxes sat on the coffee table, forgotten and cold. The group was no longer hungry. They had found their appetite for something else entirely. They had a plan. They had a recipe for revenge.
