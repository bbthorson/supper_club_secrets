# Meal 3: Crisis

## Key Events
* **The Attack:** The consequences of their investigation arrive without warning. A process server delivers a threatening Cease and Desist to Emma personally, which also contains a veiled threat about exposing her OnlyFans account.
* **The Confession & The "How?":** The group gathers for a somber Seamless dinner. Emma confesses her secret, and her friends rally around her. The immediate, panicked question becomes: "How did they know? How did they find us?"
* **The Jasper Bombshell:** As they retrace their steps, a shamefaced Jasper is forced to admit he called his friend and told her everything. The realization that his well-intentioned carelessness put them all in danger is a major turning point for his character and the group.
* **The Plan:** Their fear and defeat turn into defiant anger. They decide they can't be intimidated and formulate their calculated plan to leak the story strategically across social media.

## Group Dynamics in this Act
* This act tests the group's resolve, showcasing their solidarity in the face of a real threat.
* Their individual skills are no longer for a game but for a real fight: Olivia's local connections, Emma's influencer network, Noah's tech skills for anonymity, and Jasper's crucial role in their coordinated plan.
