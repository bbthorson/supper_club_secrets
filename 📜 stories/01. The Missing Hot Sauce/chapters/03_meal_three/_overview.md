## Meal 3 -  Crisis
### Bad Guys Close In
> Brad’s note - this feels like something I’d move to meal 3, but we’ll have to work on it
* Complications arise
* Tension increases
* Obstacles become more challenging

### All Is Lost
* **Emma** is hit with a Cease and Desist and is freaked out. She feels like they need to stop what they are doing, but the group suggests they get together.

### Dark Night of the Soul
* The group is outraged. They feel powerless, they rebel against “late stage capitalism”.
* Their meal is ordered from Seamless.

### Break into Act 3
* The group cracks a plan to strategically leak what they’ve found to a wide range of influencers on social media so as to make it too difficult for the restaurant mogul to squash.
* **Olivia** knows local people
* **Emma** knows food influencers (but has to be careful)
* **Noah** makes burner accounts, etc. to make it hard to follow
* **Jasper** must play a crucial role - saving his face.

### Finale
* Execution of the plan
* Climactic confrontation
* Resolution of the mystery
