# Meal 3: Crisis

## Key Events
* **All Is Lost:** The consequences of their investigation become terrifyingly real. A process server delivers a formal Cease and Desist letter to Emma in person, making her feel exposed and vulnerable. The mogul also threatens to expose her "Kinky Kitchen" OnlyFans account.
* **Emma's Confession:** Fearing both legal ruin and public embarrassment, Emma confesses her secret to the group. They react with immediate love and support, sympathizing with her financial situation and her fear of being exposed.
* **Dark Night of the Soul:** The friends gather for a somber meal ordered from Seamless, the mood initially defeated. As they discuss the injustice, their shared sense of powerlessness slowly curdles into a defiant anger.
* **Break into Act 3:** In a surprising turn, one of the quieter members of the group is the first to argue that they can't back down. This pivotal moment galvanizes the others, shifting the energy from despair to action. They decide to fight back by pooling their knowledge to devise an ingenious, calculated plan to leak their findings strategically across social media, making the story too big to be silenced.

## Group Dynamics in this Act
* This act tests the group's resolve, showcasing their solidarity in the face of a real threat.
* Their individual skills are no longer for a game but for a real fight: Olivia's local connections, Emma's influencer network, Noah's tech skills for anonymity, and Jasper's crucial role in their coordinated plan.
