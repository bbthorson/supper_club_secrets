### Chapter 14: The Supper Club Secret
Two weeks later, the supper club gathered again. But this time, it was a true celebration. The news story had forced the mogul to issue a public apology and offer Hank a generous settlement. The threat against Emma had vanished as if it had never existed.

The mood was light and joyful. Emma had cooked a feast, and the wine flowed freely. They were halfway through the main course when the intercom buzzed.

Emma looked around the room, confused. "Is anyone else coming?"

Jasper simply smiled. "Let him in."

A moment later, the apartment door opened, and a man stood on the threshold. He was older than they had imagined, with a kind, weathered face and a warm, slightly bewildered smile. It was Hank.

"I, uh, I was told there were some people here I needed to thank," he said, his voice filled with a genuine, heartfelt emotion.

The group was on their feet in an instant, a flurry of introductions and handshakes. They invited him to the table, and as he ate, he told them his side of the storyâ€”how the mogul had pressured him, threatened him, and bought his silence.

"I was scared," he admitted. "I didn't think anyone would care. But you did." He looked around the table at the group of friends who had accidentally become his champions. "What you all did... getting together like this, helping someone you barely knew... that's a beautiful thing. It's the kind of thing this neighborhood needs more of."

As the night ended and Hank said his goodbyes, his words lingered in the air.

"He's right, you know," Olivia said thoughtfully. "That was... kind of amazing."

"But what are the odds of something like this happening again?" Noah asked, ever the pragmatist. "I mean, how many hot sauce-related corporate conspiracies can there be in one borough?"

"Maybe it's not about conspiracies," Emma said, a slow smile spreading across her face. "Maybe it's just about paying attention." She looked around at her friends, at her funny, chaotic, brilliant family. "So, who's cooking in two weeks?"
