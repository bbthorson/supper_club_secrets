### Chapter Seventeen: Family Meal
Two weeks later, the familiar, comforting scent of roasting garlic and herbs once again filled Emma's apartment. But this time, the energy was different. The conspiratorial buzz of the past few weeks had been replaced by a deep, settled calm. It was the feeling of a battle won, a mission accomplished.

The table was laden with food, a true potluck this time. Olivia had brought a vibrant, jewel-toned beet and goat cheese tart. Elijah, in a surprising departure from his usual austerity, had made a rich, creamy potato gratin. Noah, taking Emma's earlier comments to heart, had brought a loaf of crusty, artisanal sourdough from a local bakery, admitting that "some things are better when they aren't optimized."

They were all there, settled into their usual spots, when the buzzer rang. Emma looked around, confused. "Are we expecting someone else?"

Jasper, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, just smiled. "I am."

He went to the door and opened it. Standing in the hallway, looking a little overwhelmed but with a kind, familiar face, was Hank. He held a small, unlabeled bottle of deep red hot sauce in his hands.

A stunned silence fell over the room, followed by a collective gasp. Emma was the first to find her voice. "Hank! You're... you're okay!"

Later, after the initial, joyful chaos had subsided, Hank sat on the loveseat, a plate of food balanced on his knees. He told them his story. It wasn't a dramatic tale of kidnapping or corporate espionage, but something quieter and more soul-crushing.

"It started slow," he said, his voice soft. "My sales at the little shops started to dip. The owners, my friends, they'd tell me they were being squeezed, pressured by their distributors to carry fewer local brands and more of the big, national ones. Then came the letter."

He explained the offer from the restaurant group. It was a painfully low sum, not for his recipe, but for the trademark to his family's name. They didn't want his art; they just wanted his shelf space.

"When I started asking questions, trying to negotiate," he continued, shaking his head, "the offer disappeared. Suddenly, it wasn't a deal anymore; it was a threat. Stop selling, or we'll bury you in legal fees you can't afford. I felt... broken. Like this thing my family had built, this story I was trying to tell, it didn't matter. So, I ran. Went back to the place where my great-grandmother first grew those peppers. I figured I'd just let the story die."

He looked around at the faces in the room, a deep, profound gratitude in his eyes. "And then Jasper showed up, talking about a 'swarm' and a food critic and a hundred tiny battles. You didn't just save my business. You saved my story."

He held up the bottle of hot sauce. "This is from a new batch. I'll be back at the market next weekend."

A cheer went up around the room.

As the evening wound down, a comfortable quiet settled over the group. Hank, who had been watching them with a warm smile, spoke up.

"You know," he said, "what you all have here... it's a special thing. Getting together over a meal, looking out for your community... it's beautiful."

The friends looked at each other, the weight of his words sinking in.

"He's right," Olivia said softly. "We should... we should keep doing this."

"But are there that many mysteries in Brooklyn?" Noah asked, ever the pragmatist.

"Who cares?" Jasper said with a grin. "The getting together is the point."

Emma smiled, a real, uncomplicated smile. "Okay," she said. "But I'm not cooking every time."

It was a promise. A new tradition. The first supper was over, but the Supper Club was just getting started.
