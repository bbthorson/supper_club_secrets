# Meal 4: Conclusion

## Key Events
* **Finale:** The group executes their social media plan. Their victory is not a direct confrontation but the satisfaction of watching a local news report that picks up the story, exposing the mogul and ensuring a wider audience for Hank's plight.
* **Final Image:** The story concludes with a celebratory supper club. In a move that surprises the group, Jasper reveals he found Hank not through a mysterious connection, but through clever and dedicated detective work. He brings a grateful and down-to-earth Hank to the dinner.
* **Wrap-up & The Future:** Touched by their efforts, Hank tells them that the act of getting together over food to help their community is a beautiful thing. While the group is uncertain how many mysteries Brooklyn holds, they are inspired. They agree that the gathering is what's important and decide to meet again in two weeks, with everyone bringing a "weird experience" to discuss. This sets the stage for their next adventure.
