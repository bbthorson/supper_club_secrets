### Chapter 13: The Story Breaks
By Friday, they had done all they could. The digital seeds were planted, the neighborhood whispers had reached a fever pitch, and now, all they could do was wait. They gathered at Emmaâ€™s, not for a meal, but for a vigil. The air was thick with a nervous, hopeful tension.

Noah had a dozen different browser tabs open on his laptop, which was connected to the TV. They watched as the first few ripples appeared: a small, independent food blogger posted a question on social media. Then another. A well-known local journalist tweeted that she was looking into rumors of a "vendor dispute" in Williamsburg.

"It's starting," Olivia whispered, her hands clasped together.

The ripples grew. More bloggers picked up the story, then a larger online food magazine. By early evening, the hashtag #WhereIsHank was trending in Brooklyn. The story was no longer theirs; it belonged to the internet.

The true victory came just after 10 PM. A local news channel broke from its regularly scheduled programming with a "developing story." The face of a well-respected investigative reporter filled the screen.

"A story of corporate overreach is unfolding tonight in Williamsburg," she began, "as a powerful restaurant mogul is facing questions over the disappearance of a beloved local hot sauce vendor..."

A cheer erupted in the apartment. It was a loud, joyous, cathartic sound. They had done it. They had taken on a giant and, against all odds, they had won. They watched, mesmerized, as the reporter laid out the very facts they had painstakingly gathered, their anonymous brief now being broadcast to the entire city.
