### Chapter 12: A Thousand Ripples
The days that followed were a blur of focused, clandestine activity. Emma’s apartment transformed from a cozy home into a guerilla PR firm.

Noah was the architect of their operation. He worked with a quiet, intense focus, building what he called the "digital ghost." He set up a series of encrypted email accounts and temporary, untraceable blogs, creating a network of digital cutouts designed to vanish the moment their work was done. He fed Elijah’s meticulously crafted brief—a dry, devastatingly factual account of the mogul’s actions—into this network, preparing to arm their digital army.

Olivia, meanwhile, worked her magic on the ground. She moved through the neighborhood like a phantom, having quiet conversations with the shop owners and community leaders in her network. She didn't spread rumors; she asked questions. "Have you heard about what happened to Hank? Isn't it strange that this new waterfront restaurant is opening right after?" She planted seeds of doubt, creating a groundswell of local concern that would be impossible for any local journalist to ignore.

Emma’s task was the most delicate. She scrolled through her list of food bloggers and journalists, people she had cultivated professional relationships with for years. She couldn't risk her own reputation, so her approach was subtle. She sent carefully worded, anonymous tips through Noah’s ghost network, framing the story as a matter of community interest. A beloved local artisan, a powerful developer, a suspicious timeline. You might want to look into this.

Oliver and Elijah became the fact-checkers, working in tandem to verify every claim and cross-reference every new piece of information Olivia uncovered. They were building a fortress of evidence, ensuring that when the story broke, it would be unassailable.

And Jasper, humbled and eager to atone, was given the most important job of all: find Hank. He didn't call any of his high-powered friends. Instead, he started with the basics. He spent hours at the library, poring over old newspaper articles about the Greenmarket. He visited every other farmers market in the five boroughs, showing a picture of Hank he'd found online to every vendor he could find. It was slow, tedious, unglamorous work. It was his penance.
