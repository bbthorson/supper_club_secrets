### Chapter Sixteen: The Missing Ingredient

While the digital war was being waged from Emma's living room, Jasper stood in his chaotic apartment, feeling utterly useless. His phone buzzed with updates from the group chat—Noah's sentiment graphs, Olivia's influencer confirmations, the food critic's devastating endorsement. Victory after victory, all happening without him.
He'd caused this mess. The least he could do was fix the part that mattered most.
Jasper closed his eyes, trying to remember that first dinner party. Emma's voice, tipsy and animated, describing Hank's theatrical pitch. What had she said? Something about a pepper. A weird pepper.
"...and he swears the secret is this crazy pepper his great-great-grandmother brought up from Philly, calls it a 'Fish Pepper' or something..."
Fish Pepper. That was it.
He grabbed his laptop and started searching. Within ten minutes, he'd confirmed it was real—a rare heirloom variety with distinctive green and white striped skin, famous in African-American culinary history along the Chesapeake Bay. You couldn't just buy these at a garden center. You had to know someone.
And knowing someone was Jasper's actual superpower.
He started calling. Small nurseries in Maryland first, then Pennsylvania. His approach was pure Jasper—equal parts charm and barely-controlled chaos.
"Hi, yes, I'm looking for a... well, it's complicated, but there's this guy, a hot sauce artisan, and he's gone missing, and I think he might be growing Fish Peppers, which I know sounds insane, but—"
Click. Dead line.
He tried again. And again. Most people hung up within thirty seconds. A few listened politely before explaining they'd never heard of such a person. One elderly man in Baltimore spent twenty minutes telling Jasper about his own pepper garden before admitting he'd never grown Fish Peppers in his life.
By Tuesday afternoon, Jasper was on his fifteenth call, sitting on a park bench in McCarren Park, staring at the empty spot where Hank's stall used to be. He was about to give up when a woman at a small nursery outside Philadelphia paused at his question.
"Fish Peppers?" she said slowly. "The striped ones? You're not talking about the Meadowlight Collective, are you?"
Jasper sat up straight. "The what?"
"It's a little intentional community about two hours west of here. Artists, growers, back-to-the-land types. They're the only folks I know who still grow the old striped varieties. Real purists about heirloom seeds."
Jasper was already pulling up directions on his phone. "Can you give me an address?"

---

The drive took three hours, most of it on increasingly narrow rural roads. Jasper's ancient Subaru rattled over potholes as GPS cheerfully insisted he'd arrived at his destination—a dirt driveway marked only by a hand-painted sign reading "Meadowlight."
The collective was a cluster of weathered buildings arranged around a central farmhouse. Gardens sprawled in every direction, wild and abundant. A few people worked in the fields, but they barely looked up as Jasper parked.
He found a woman in her sixties sitting on the porch of the main house, shelling peas into a bowl.
"Hi," Jasper said, suddenly aware of how out of place he looked—Brooklyn skinny jeans and a vintage band t-shirt in the middle of rural Pennsylvania. "I'm looking for someone. A guy who makes hot sauce. I think he might be here?"
The woman studied him for a long moment. "You a reporter?"
"No. Friend of a friend. He's been through some stuff, and I just... I need to talk to him."
"He's been through enough," she said, her voice protective. "If you're here to cause more trouble—"
"I'm here to tell him he won," Jasper interrupted, surprising himself with the conviction in his voice. "We won. All of us. That's why I drove three hours to find him."
Another long pause. Then she nodded toward a greenhouse at the edge of the property. "He's probably in there. With the peppers."

---

The greenhouse was humid and thick with the smell of earth and growing things. Rows of plants stretched toward the glass ceiling, their leaves catching the late afternoon light. At the far end, a man was bent over a row of distinctive striped pepper plants, his hands moving with careful precision.
"Hank?" Jasper called out.
The man straightened slowly. He was older than Jasper expected, maybe mid-fifties, with kind eyes and calloused hands. Recognition flickered across his face. "You're one of Emma's friends. From the market."
"Jasper," he confirmed, walking closer. His usual chaotic energy was gone, replaced by something quieter. "Listen, I need to tell you something. About what happened after you left."
Hank set down his pruning shears. "How did you even find me?"
"Fish Peppers," Jasper said simply. "Emma remembered you talking about them. Took me about twenty phone calls, but..." He shrugged.
A small smile crossed Hank's face. "She remembered that?"
"She remembered everything," Jasper said. "That's why I'm here."
He told Hank the whole story—the investigation that started as a drunken game, the discovery of the LLC, the cease and desist letter. He told him about Emma's secret and the group's decision to fight back. He described the swarm strategy, the food critic's endorsement, the sentiment shift. He didn't spare himself, explaining how his own loose lips had nearly ruined everything.
Hank listened without interrupting, his expression unreadable. When Jasper finished, silence filled the greenhouse.
"They did all that?" Hank said finally. "For me?"
"For your story," Jasper corrected gently. "Your great-grandmother's story. That's what they were trying to steal. Your shelf space, sure, but really? They wanted to erase you. Make it like you never existed." He gestured at the peppers. "These plants, this history—they wanted to own it without earning it. And we couldn't let that happen."
Hank's hand rested on one of the striped leaves, his fingers gentle. "I don't know if I can go back," he said quietly. "Every time I think about setting up that stall again, about facing those people..."
"You don't have to decide right now," Jasper said. "But Emma's making dinner two weeks from Sunday. And I think you should meet the people who fought for you. Not because they wanted something, but because they gave a shit about what your hot sauce meant." He paused. "That's all I'm asking. Just dinner."
Hank looked at the peppers, then at the dirt under his fingernails, then back at Jasper. "What if I'm not ready?"
"Then you're not ready," Jasper said simply. "But you'll never know unless you show up."
A long moment passed. Then Hank nodded slowly. "Two weeks?"
"Two weeks," Jasper confirmed. "I'll drive you back myself if you want."
"I'll drive myself," Hank said, and there was something firmer in his voice now. "I need to do this part on my own." He extended his hand. "Thank you for finding me."
Jasper shook it, feeling the calluses, the strength. "Thank you for coming back."
As Jasper drove back to Brooklyn that evening, his phone exploded with messages from the group chat. The story had gone viral. The mogul's investors were pulling out. They'd won.
But for Jasper, the real victory was smaller and more personal. He'd found Hank. He'd made it right.
For once, his chaos had pointed in the right direction.
