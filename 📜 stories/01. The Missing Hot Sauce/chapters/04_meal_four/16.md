### Chapter Sixteen: The Missing Ingredient
While the digital war was being waged from Emma's living room, Jasper was on a different kind of mission. He felt a bit useless amidst the storm of VPNs and sentiment analysis. His skills were analog, chaotic, and decidedly low-tech. As he watched his friends execute Oliver's brilliant strategy, he felt a familiar restlessness. Their victory in the court of public opinion was crucial, but it didn't solve the original problem: Hank was still missing.

He paced his apartment, the triumphant texts from the group buzzing in his pocket. He thought back to the very beginning, to that first dinner party. He closed his eyes, trying to picture Emma as she described Hank and his hot sauce. He remembered her frustration, her passion, and her imitation of Hank's theatrical sales pitch.

And then, a stray detail, a piece of conversational lint that his brain had snagged and stored away, floated to the surface.

"...and he swears the secret is this crazy pepper his great-great-grandmother brought up from Philly, calls it a 'Fish Pepper' or something, says it's the only thing that gives it that... zing."

It was a nothing comment, a throwaway line in a tipsy story. But to Jasper, it was everything. It was a name. A weird name. A name he could work with.

He dove into his own version of research, a chaotic but surprisingly effective series of clicks and calls. He started online, confirming that the "Fish Pepper" was real. It was a rare, heirloom variety, famous for its unique striped skin and its deep roots in the African-American culinary history of the Chesapeake Bay area.  It wasn't something you could buy at Whole Foods. You had to know someone.

And Jasper, for all his chaos, knew how to find someone. He bypassed the official seed exchanges and large agricultural suppliers. He started calling small, independent nurseries in Pennsylvania and Maryland, his questions a bizarre mix of charm and half-baked conspiracy.

"Hello? Yes, I'm trying to track down a... a rogue horticulturist, a real pepper phantom," he'd say. "He's a master of the Fish Pepper. Does that name ring any bells?"

Most of the calls were dead ends. But then, a woman at a small, family-run farm just outside of Philadelphia paused. "A Fish Pepper evangelist, you say? Sounds like you're looking for the folks at the Meadowlight Collective. They're the only ones around here who still grow the old striped variety. Real purists."

He got the address. It wasn't a farm; it was a small, intentional community about two hours outside the city. A place for artists and growers. A place a man might go to lay low and reconnect with his roots.

Jasper grabbed his keys. He didn't text the group. This was his mission. He was going to bring Hank home.
