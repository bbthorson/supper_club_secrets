# Group Dynamics

## Core Tensions & Alliances

### Emma & Noah (Tradition vs. Tech)
*   Emma prefers traditional, hands-on methods, while Noah is a firm believer in tech-based solutions. This often leads to playful clashes over the best way to approach a problem.
*   Noah's pedantic minimalism and love for logical systems puts him in frequent, playful conflict with Emma's methods. His secret love for the aesthetics and consumerism of sneaker collecting is a major hypocrisy he hides, fearing judgment from her.

### Elijah & Oliver (The Analysts)
*   These two bond over their shared analytical and detail-oriented approaches. They are the most grounded and logical members of the group, often working together to sort facts from speculation.
*   While both are pragmatists, Oliver's realism is innate and historical, while Elijah's is a learned survival strategy, which can lead to slightly different conclusions.

### Jasper & The Group (The Chaos Agent)
*   The group views Jasper as a source of unconventional ideas, but his primary function is as a "chaos agent." His conspiracy theories are a form of play for him, a game of provocation that he uses to liven things up.
*   This performance often energizes Olivia (who loves the drama), exasperates Noah (who hates the illogicality), and is met with historical counter-arguments from Oliver and dry, sarcastic silence from Elijah.

### Olivia & Oliver (The Couple)
*   Olivia's social energy helps draw the shy, bookish Oliver out of his shell. He, in turn, provides a grounding presence.
*   However, his social dependency on her is a source of low-grade anxiety for Olivia. His secret, prolific online life in niche communities is a private outlet he protects, making him even less likely to build independent relationships within the group.

## Other Key Dynamics
*   **Emma & Elijah:** While they bond over their shared empathy and less-privileged upbringings, a core tension exists between them. Emma, despite her own past failures, wishes Elijah were more of a risk-taker, while her newfound reliance on intuition can frustrate his deep-seated, survival-based pragmatism.
*   **Emma & Olivia:** Beyond their friendship, Emma deeply admires Olivia's effortless social grace, a skill Emma feels she lacks, especially when dealing with people outside her comfort zone (like Noah's tech friends).
