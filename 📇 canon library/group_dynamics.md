# Group Dynamics

## Core Tensions & Alliances

### Emma & Noah (Tradition vs. Tech)
*   Emma prefers traditional, hands-on methods, while Noah is a firm believer in tech-based solutions. This often leads to playful clashes over the best way to approach a problem.

### Elijah & Oliver (The Analysts)
*   These two bond over their shared analytical and detail-oriented approaches. They are the most grounded and logical members of the group, often working together to sort facts from speculation.

### Jasper & Noah (Chaos vs. Order)
*   Jasper's chaotic, rule-breaking nature is a constant source of playful arguments with Noah, who values order, logic, and structure.

### Olivia & Oliver (The Couple)
*   Olivia's social energy helps draw the shy, bookish Oliver out of his shell. He, in turn, provides a grounding presence that balances her more free-spirited energy.

## Other Key Dynamics
*   **The Core Trio:** Emma bonds with Olivia over their shared experiences as women and with Elijah over their less-privileged upbringings.
*   **Jasper's Role:** The group relies on Jasper for his unconventional ideas and unexpected connections, even though his methods are unpredictable and can lead to setbacks.
*   **Noah's Role:** Despite the teasing about his idealism, the group values Noah for his ability to quickly find information online.
