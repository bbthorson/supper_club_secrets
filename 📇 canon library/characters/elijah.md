Elijah - the rigid analyst
 * Analytical mind, pragmatic approach, quietly empathetic and bonds with Emma over that, though quietly. He's a logical thinker who prefers to focus on facts and evidence. He's not easily swayed by emotions or speculation.
 * Works at an investment bank. He landed the job after graduating from an Ivy League school, but he hasn't climbed the corporate ladder as quickly as his classmates. He feels pressure to succeed to support his family and is risk-averse, partly due to his background and experiences with subtle discrimination.
 * Gets along with Noah and Oliver. He bonds with Noah over their systematic thinking and with Oliver over their detail-oriented approach to problem-solving. He sometimes finds Jasper annoying because he reminds him of his privileged college classmates.
 * Enjoys archery. This hobby reflects his focused and disciplined nature. It also provides a contrast to his high-pressure job and allows him to unwind and de-stress.
 * Pragmatic but enjoys the chaos. While he's one of the most grounded members of the group, he also appreciates the humor and energy that his friends bring to their investigations. He's amused by their outlandish theories and enjoys watching them brainstorm and debate.
 * Character Arc: Balancing work, personal life, and finding fulfillment in helping others. He'll learn to take risks, both personally and professionally, and to find satisfaction in using his skills to help his friends and community.
