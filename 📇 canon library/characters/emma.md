Emma - the grounded creative
 * Bubbly energy, optimistic, empathetic. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and she often uses humor to lighten the mood. She's quick to offer encouragement and support to her friends, even when they're feeling down.
 * Initially skeptical of mysteries ("There's a logical explanation for everything!"). She's a practical thinker who prefers to focus on the facts. However, she's also open to new possibilities, especially when they involve her friends.
 * Skills: Culinary expertise, food industry connections. Her passion for cooking began with Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and her grandmother's buttery baking. She trained in French cuisine and worked at a French bistro, but she dreams of opening a restaurant that combines French techniques with Southern comfort food.
 * Character Arc: Learning to trust her intuition and see beyond the surface. She'll discover that not everything can be explained by logic and that sometimes, you have to follow your gut.
 * Has a secret Kinky Kitchen OnlyFans. She creates mildly suggestive content, often incorporating food and cooking barefoot, catering to a niche kink audience. This secret adds a layer of vulnerability to her character, as she fears being exposed and judged by her friends.
 * Closest with Olivia and Elijah. She bonds with Olivia over their shared experiences as women and with Elijah over their less-privileged upbringings. She maintains a healthy emotional distance from Oliver due to her close friendship with Olivia. She rarely takes Jasper seriously and relies on Noah for help with technology.
 * Economic concerns: She's facing financial challenges after leaving her job and relying on freelance writing gigs and her OnlyFans income. This adds to her stress and vulnerability throughout the story.
