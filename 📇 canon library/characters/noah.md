# Noah

## Overview
An idealistic and sometimes naive techie who believes technology can solve any problem.

## Personality
*   A strong believer in tech utopianism, convinced that technology and automation are the ultimate solutions.
*   His first instinct is to dismiss problems that don't have a clean, immediate digital solution.
*   Naive and easily swayed by new ideas, except when they come from Jasper.
*   Pedantically minimalist, obsessed with owning only one type and color of t-shirt.
*   When trying to persuade others, he tends to lead with technical jargon before resorting to oversimplified logic if he isn't being understood.

## Background
*   Works as a computer engineer at a late-stage startup with an unclear purpose.
*   He is the least knowledgeable about the neighborhood, as he is a creature of habit who buys everything online.
*   His tech utopianism stems from a childhood where he became the de-facto tech support for his parents. He grew to love the predictable, logical nature of computers (defined inputs/outputs) and is frustrated that humans are not as easy to understand.

## Skills
*   Rapid online research.
*   Finding tech-savvy solutions to problems.

## Relationships

*   **Jasper:** Has a playful rivalry with him, often clashing over Jasper's disregard for rules and structure.

## Character Arc
*   To learn to balance his idealism with reality, discovering that not all solutions can be found online and that human connection is just as important.

## Secrets

## Notes
*   His friends often tease him for his idealism but value his quick detective work.
