Noah - the idealistic techie
 * Believes strongly in tech utopianism. He's convinced that technology and automation can solve any problem. This often leads to clashes with Emma, who prefers traditional methods.
 * Naive and easily swayed. He's open to new ideas and perspectives, sometimes to a fault. He can be convinced to change his mind by almost anyone, except for Jasper, whose chaotic nature clashes with his own desire for order and logic.
 * Works as a computer engineer at a late-stage startup. The company's purpose is unclear, adding a touch of mystery to his character.
 * Bonds with Olivia. They connect over their shared optimism and somewhat naive worldview. He gets along with everyone in the group but has a playful rivalry with Jasper. Their arguments often center on Jasper's disregard for rules and structure, which irks Noah's sense of order.
 * Least knowledgeable about the neighborhood. He's a creature of habit who buys everything online and sticks to his routines. This makes him reliant on technology and less connected to the local community.
 * Minimalist in a pedantic way. He's obsessed with owning only one type and color of t-shirt, showcasing his rigid adherence to his own set of rules.
 * Skills: Rapid online research, tech-savvy solutions. He's adept at finding information quickly and using technology to solve problems.
 * Character Arc: Learning to balance idealism with reality. He'll discover that not all solutions can be found online and that sometimes, human connection and traditional methods are just as important.
