Jasper - the wildcard
 * Mysterious job. He works at the DMV, or a similar bureaucratic agency. He speaks about his work in vague, high-level terms, leading his friends to suspect he doesn't have a job. He's not concerned about keeping the job because he doesn't need the money.
 * Unexpected connections, out-of-the-box thinking. He can often make a call to a friend of a friend to access non-public information. He believes societal rules and norms are not truly enforced and behaves as a free spirit, often pushing boundaries and challenging expectations.
 * Loves to cause chaos but ultimately wants everyone to get along. He enjoys stirring the pot and creating a bit of drama, but he genuinely cares about his friends and wants them to be happy. He respects Elijah's principles, even if he disagrees with them, and loves to tease Noah. He admires Emma's grounded nature and tries to help Oliver come out of his shell while also preventing Olivia from being overbearing.
 * Skills: Accessing non-public information, thinking outside the box, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds.
 * Character Arc: Finding his place in the group and learning discretion. He'll learn to balance his free-spirited nature with the needs of his friends and the importance of respecting boundaries.
