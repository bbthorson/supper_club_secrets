### Chapter Fourteen: A Bitter Taste

The Thai food arrived, but no one was particularly hungry. They picked at pad thai and spring rolls, the normalcy of the meal feeling absurd against the weight of what had happened.

"It's fucked up," Olivia said again, her voice low and angry. "It's completely fucked up that he can just do this."

"But he can," Elijah said, his voice flat. "This is what they do. This is what people with this kind of money and power always do. They don't have to win in court. They just have to make the fight so expensive and so miserable that you give up." He looked around at his friends. "We are not equipped for this. This is how people lose their apartments. This is how people go bankrupt. We have to stop."

His words, pragmatic and brutal, hung in the air. He was right. They all knew it. The triumphant energy of their last dinner felt like a distant, naive memory. They were no longer detectives; they were just a group of friends who had flown too close to the sun.

It was Noah who broke the heavy silence, his voice laced with a new, unsettling thought. "But how did they even know?" He looked around the room, his systematic mind working through the logic. "How did they know to target Emma specifically? I did a full data sweep on the restaurant group, the LLC, everything. Emma's name doesn't appear anywhere in public records connected to this. So how did they connect her to the investigation?"

An uncomfortable pause.

"Maybe they're just guessing?" Olivia offered weakly. "Going after local food people?"

"No," Noah said, shaking his head. "That's not how this works. They sent a process server to her specific address with a personalized threat. They knew exactly who to target." He looked genuinely perplexed. "Someone had to have told them. Someone had to have connected Emma to the investigation."

The implication hung in the air, heavy and poisonous.

"Wait," Jasper said slowly, his usual chaos replaced by dawning horror. "Are you saying someone in this room—"

"No!" Olivia said quickly. "That's not what he's saying."

"Then what is he saying?" Jasper pressed, looking at Noah.

Noah held up his hands. "I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just trying to understand the information flow. Who knew about this investigation outside of us?"

Silence descended on the group. They looked at each other, the question unspoken but clear: Who talked?

Emma watched the doubt creep across her friends' faces. Oliver looked uncomfortable, his gaze fixed on his lap. Elijah's jaw was tight, his analytical mind clearly running through possibilities. Olivia's eyes darted between them all, protective and worried.

And Jasper... Jasper had gone very still. His face was pale, all the color drained from his usually animated features. He was staring at his uneaten pad thai, his hands gripping his knees.

"Jasper?" Emma said softly.

He looked up, and in that moment, they all knew.

"It was me," he whispered.

"What?" Elijah said sharply.

"My friend," Jasper said, his voice cracking. He wouldn't meet anyone's eyes. "Marcus. From the 311 call center—he works at the Department of Buildings now. I called him. I told him everything." The words came out in a rush, desperate. "The whole story. The investigation, the LLC, I gave him Emma's name as the one who discovered it all, I thought—God, I thought I was helping. I thought I was the hero who cracked the case."

"You told him about Emma's account?" Olivia asked, her voice caught between disbelief and horror.

"No! God, no," Jasper said, finally looking up, his eyes red. "I didn't know about that. I just... I told him about the investigation. About Emma leading it. And his department—they deal with that developer all the time. He must have told them. Or felt like he had to." He slumped forward, his face in his hands. "I'm so sorry, Ems. I'm so, so sorry. I was just trying to help. I was trying to be useful."

The confession hung in the air, devastating in its simplicity. It wasn't a sophisticated hack or a corporate spy. It was just Jasper, doing what Jasper always did—talking to everyone, connecting dots, trusting too easily—and accidentally lighting the fuse.

"You idiot," Noah breathed, the words quiet but sharp.

"I know," Jasper said miserably.

"Do you?" Noah's voice rose, and there was something ugly in it—a cruelty that surprised even him. "Do you have any idea what you've done? You painted a target on Emma's back. You gave them ammunition. You—" He stood up, his usual measured calm completely gone. "This is why I don't tell you things, Jasper. This is exactly why. Because you can't help yourself. You have to be the center of attention, you have to be the one who 'cracks the case,' and you never, ever think about the consequences."

Jasper flinched like he'd been slapped. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Noah's voice was cold now. "How many of your 'brilliant ideas' have blown up in someone else's face? How many times have we cleaned up after you?"

"Noah," Olivia said warningly. "That's enough."

"Is it? Because I'm tired of pretending that Jasper's chaos is charming. It's not. It's exhausting."

Jasper stood up to face him, and for a moment there was real hurt in his eyes—not defensive anger, but genuine, deep-seated pain. "You think I don't know that? You think I don't know I'm the liability in this group? The one who's never quite smart enough, who never quite fits, who's always trying too hard because—" His voice cracked. "Because I don't know any other way to be useful."

The room went very quiet.

Elijah, who had been watching the escalation with growing discomfort, finally spoke. "We all make mistakes. The question is what we do next." But even his measured tone couldn't quite bridge the chasm that had opened.

Olivia moved to Jasper's side, instinctively protective. Emma, wrapped in her blanket, watched her two friends—Noah rigid with righteous anger, Jasper crumpled with guilt—and felt something shift in the room. This wasn't a mystery anymore. This was their friendship, cracking under pressure.

And then Oliver stood up.

Everyone turned. He wasn't tall or imposing, but something in his posture commanded attention. His hands were shaking slightly—Emma noticed because she was looking for it—but his voice was steady.

"Stop," he said, louder than anyone expected. He took a breath, and Emma could see him gathering himself, reaching for something he normally kept hidden. "This is what he wants." He looked at each of them in turn, meeting their eyes in a way he almost never did. "He wants us scared. He wants us fighting each other. Because if we do that, he wins without lifting a finger."

He gestured at the legal document. "Elijah's right that this is toothless. It's intimidation, not law. It's a letter that says 'we have more money than you, so please give up.'" He paused. "To surrender to that is to... to validate the idea that the rules don't apply to people with enough lawyers. And that's..." He searched for the words, his usual hesitancy flickering across his face. "That's a precedent we can't accept. Statistically. Historically. Morally."

Noah was staring at him. They all were. Oliver rarely spoke this much in a single sitting, let alone took command of a room.

"You've been in situations like this before," Elijah said slowly. It wasn't a question.

"Online," Oliver admitted, a faint flush crossing his cheeks. "I moderate some... communities. Forums. Places where bad actors try to intimidate people with lawyers and doxxing and threats. The playbook is always the same: create fear, create division, wait for the target to self-destruct." He took another breath. "The counter-strategy is also always the same: refuse to be afraid. Refuse to fight each other. Make the fight collective."

He stood there, awkward but resolute, and for the first time his friends saw not just shy, bookish Oliver, but a glimpse of the person he was online—the respected moderator, the voice of reason in chaotic spaces. The one who had talked strangers down from panic attacks and coordinated takedowns of actual trolls.

"We are not going to be scared," he said, his voice gaining strength. "We are not going to fight each other. We are going to fight him."

Noah looked at Jasper. Something complicated crossed his face—shame, maybe, for the things he'd said. He didn't apologize, not yet, but he sat back down. The rigid anger drained out of his shoulders.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Okay. What's the plan?"
