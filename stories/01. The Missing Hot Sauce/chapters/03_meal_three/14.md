### Chapter Fourteen: A Bitter Taste

The Thai food arrived, but no one was particularly hungry. They picked at pad thai and spring rolls, the normalcy of the meal feeling absurd against the weight of what had happened.

"It's fucked up," Olivia said again, her voice low and angry. "It's completely fucked up that he can just do this."

"But he can," Elijah said, his voice flat. "This is what they do. This is what people with this kind of money and power always do. They don't have to win in court. They just have to make the fight so expensive and so miserable that you give up." He looked around at his friends. "We are not equipped for this. This is how people lose their apartments. This is how people go bankrupt. We have to stop."

His words, pragmatic and brutal, hung in the air. He was right. They all knew it. The triumphant energy of their last dinner felt like a distant, naive memory. They were no longer detectives; they were just a group of friends who had flown too close to the sun.

It was Noah who broke the heavy silence, his voice laced with a new, unsettling thought. "But how did they even know?" He looked around the room, his systematic mind working through the logic. "How did they know to target Emma specifically? I did a full data sweep on the restaurant group, the LLC, everything. Emma's name doesn't appear anywhere in public records connected to this. So how did they connect her to the investigation?"

An uncomfortable pause.

"Maybe they're just guessing?" Olivia offered weakly. "Going after local food people?"

"No," Noah said, shaking his head. "That's not how this works. They sent a process server to her specific address with a personalized threat. They knew exactly who to target." He looked genuinely perplexed. "Someone had to have told them. Someone had to have connected Emma to the investigation."

The implication hung in the air, heavy and poisonous.

"Wait," Jasper said slowly, his usual chaos replaced by dawning horror. "Are you saying someone in this room—"

"No!" Olivia said quickly. "That's not what he's saying."

"Then what is he saying?" Jasper pressed, looking at Noah.

Noah held up his hands. "I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just trying to understand the information flow. Who knew about this investigation outside of us?"

Silence descended on the group. They looked at each other, the question unspoken but clear: Who talked?

Emma watched the doubt creep across her friends' faces. Oliver looked uncomfortable, his gaze fixed on his lap. Elijah's jaw was tight, his analytical mind clearly running through possibilities. Olivia's eyes darted between them all, protective and worried.

And Jasper... Jasper had gone very still. His face was pale, all the color drained from his usually animated features. He was staring at his uneaten pad thai, his hands gripping his knees.

"Jasper?" Emma said softly.

He looked up, and in that moment, they all knew.

"It was me," he whispered.

"What?" Elijah said sharply.

"My friend," Jasper said, his voice cracking. He wouldn't meet anyone's eyes. "Marcus. From the 311 call center—he works at the Department of Buildings now. I called him. I told him everything." The words came out in a rush, desperate. "The whole story. The investigation, the LLC, I gave him Emma's name as the one who discovered it all, I thought—God, I thought I was helping. I thought I was the hero who cracked the case."

"You told him about Emma's account?" Olivia asked, her voice caught between disbelief and horror.

"No! God, no," Jasper said, finally looking up, his eyes red. "I didn't know about that. I just... I told him about the investigation. About Emma leading it. And his department—they deal with that developer all the time. He must have told them. Or felt like he had to." He slumped forward, his face in his hands. "I'm so sorry, Ems. I'm so, so sorry. I was just trying to help. I was trying to be useful."

The confession hung in the air, devastating in its simplicity. It wasn't a sophisticated hack or a corporate spy. It was just Jasper, doing what Jasper always did—talking to everyone, connecting dots, trusting too easily—and accidentally lighting the fuse.

"You idiot," Noah breathed, the words quiet but sharp.

"I know," Jasper said miserably.

"Do you?" Noah's voice rose. "Do you have any idea what you've done? You painted a target on Emma's back!"

"I was trying to help!" Jasper shot back, a flash of his old defensiveness returning. "I was the only one who got a real lead! I confirmed the LLC!"

"A real lead that led them right to Emma's door!"

The argument escalated, voices rising, years of friendly tension suddenly not so friendly. Olivia tried to intervene, but Noah and Jasper were both standing now, facing each other.

"Stop," a quiet voice said.

Everyone turned. Oliver had stood up. He wasn't tall or imposing, but something in his posture commanded attention. His usual shy demeanor was gone, replaced by something harder.

"Stop," he said again, louder this time. "This is what he wants." He looked at each of them in turn. "He wants us scared. He wants us fighting each other. Because if we do that, he wins." He gestured at the legal document. "Elijah's right that this is toothless. It's intimidation, not law." He paused, gathering himself. "To surrender to it is to... to validate the idea that the rules don't apply to the powerful. And that's..." He searched for the words. "That's a precedent we can't accept. Statistically. Historically."

He stood there, awkward but resolute, and for the first time his friends saw not just shy, bookish Oliver, but a glimpse of the person he was online—the respected moderator, the voice of reason in chaotic spaces.

"We are not going to be scared," he said, his voice gaining strength. "We are not going to fight each other. We are going to fight him."
