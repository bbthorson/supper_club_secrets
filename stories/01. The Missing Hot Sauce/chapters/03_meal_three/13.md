### Chapter Thirteen: Emergency Supper

"Hey, you!" Olivia's voice was a bright, cheerful burst through the phone. "I was just thinking about you. Marcus at The Gilded Fern asked if we'd cracked the case yet. The whole neighborhood is talking."

"Liv," Emma choked out, her voice a raw whisper. "Something's happened."

The cheer in Olivia's voice vanished, replaced by a cold, sharp focus. "What is it? What's wrong?"

Emma tried to explain—the man at the door, the legal document, the handwritten note—but the words kept catching in her throat, coming out in ragged, panicked bursts.

Olivia listened without interrupting, her silence a steady, grounding presence. When Emma finally managed to get the whole story out, Olivia's first words weren't of fear, but of pure, unadulterated rage.

"That son of a bitch," she hissed, her voice tight with fury. "That cowardly little man." She took a deep breath. "Listen to me, Ems. This is what they do. I've had cease and desists from competitors for my candle line. They're just trying to scare you. It's a bully tactic because they know they're in the wrong."

"But he knows, Liv," Emma whispered. "He knows about my... my account."

"He knows you're a smart, creative woman who found a way to make a living in a world that is not built for us," Olivia shot back, her voice fierce and protective. "That's all he knows. And we are not going to let him use it against you." She paused, the sound of her typing quickly in the background. "Okay. I'm starting a group text. Everyone, your place, tonight. This is a five-alarm fire."

"But it's a Wednesday," Emma said weakly. "Elijah's probably working, Noah has his coding thing..."

"I don't care," Olivia said, her voice leaving no room for argument. "They'll get here when they get here. I'm on my way."

The line went dead. Emma stood in the silence, the phone still pressed to her ear. For the first time since the knock, she felt a tiny, fragile flicker of hope. She wasn't alone. The cavalry was coming.

---

An hour later, the mood in Emma's apartment was funereal. Olivia had arrived first, enveloping Emma in a fierce hug before immediately taking charge, her usual bubbly energy replaced by a grim, protective efficiency. Oliver and Noah had arrived together soon after, their faces etched with a shared, anxious concern.

The legal document sat on the coffee table, a toxic centerpiece in the middle of the room. They had all read it. They had all seen the handwritten note. Now, they were sitting in a heavy, suffocating silence, the sheer, paralyzing reality of the situation sinking in.

"We should eat," Olivia said finally, breaking the silence. "We need to eat."

Emma looked around at the legal document, the worried faces, the chaos of her apartment. "Yeah," she said, her voice flat. "Let me just redd up a little first." The Pittsburghese slipped out before she could catch it, a sure sign she was more rattled than she was letting on.

It was a simple, practical suggestion, but it immediately devolved into a low-grade, stress-fueled chaos.

"What are we in the mood for?" Oliver asked, already scrolling through a delivery app on his phone.

"I don't care," Emma mumbled from the couch, where she was wrapped in a blanket.

"Okay, but we have to pick something," Noah said, seeing not a human crisis, but a logistical problem that needed to be solved. "The optimal solution is to find a single cuisine that satisfies the dietary restrictions and preferences of at least eighty percent of the group."

"It's not a math problem, Noah," Olivia snapped, her patience already worn thin.

"Fine," Noah conceded, shifting to a new tactic. "Let's just get pizza. Pizza has a ninety-four percent satisfaction rating across all demographics."

"Absolutely not," Jasper said, having just arrived and taken in the scene. "We are never, ever, doing a group pizza order again. Not after the 2nd Avenue Pizza Debacle."

A flicker of a shared, traumatic memory passed between him and Noah. Olivia shuddered. "He's right. We spent forty-five minutes arguing about toppings and ended up with six pizzas, three of which nobody ate."

"We're ordering Thai," Olivia announced with finality, already scrolling. "I'm not discussing this further."

The door buzzed. It was Elijah. He stepped into the apartment, immediately loosening his tie—he'd clearly come straight from the office. His eyes landed on the document on the table. He didn't need to ask what had happened. He picked it up, his face a mask of cold, analytical fury as he read.

He stood by the window for a moment, his back to the room, before he turned around. He was doing that thing he did when he was processing—the stillness, the careful assessment. Emma recognized it from the time he'd helped her negotiate her freelance contracts. It was his "this is serious, let me think" mode.

"Walk me through it," he said, not to Emma, but to Olivia. "Chronologically. What happened, when, in what order."

Olivia recounted it: the knock, the process server, the document, the handwritten note. As she spoke, Elijah pulled out his phone and started typing—Emma realized he was taking notes, probably in that obsessive spreadsheet app he used for everything.

"And you didn't sign anything," he confirmed. "You didn't agree to anything."

"No. I just... closed the door."

"Good." He pocketed his phone. "That's good."

Noah, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, was hunched over his laptop in the corner. He hadn't said a word since arriving, which was unusual—normally he'd have three opinions and a data visualization by now. Instead, he was just typing, his face lit by the screen.

"Noah?" Olivia said. "You okay over there?"

"I'm looking up trademark law," he said without looking up. "Cease and desist procedures. Legal precedents." He paused to scroll. "Did you know that ninety-four percent of these letters never result in actual litigation? They're primarily used as a psychological pressure tactic."

"That's... not actually comforting right now," Emma said.

"It should be," Noah said, still not looking up. "Statistically, you're going to be fine."

Oliver, sitting in the armchair near the window, said nothing. He was watching the room with that quiet, observant intensity that Emma sometimes forgot he had. His hands were folded in his lap, very still. He hadn't touched his phone once.

Jasper, meanwhile, was vibrating with barely-contained energy—but it was a different kind of energy than usual. He kept starting sentences and then stopping, looking at the document on the table, then looking away. He'd made two cups of tea and drunk neither of them.

"You okay, Jasp?" Emma asked.

"Fine," he said too quickly. "Just—processing. This is a lot."

Elijah looked up from his notes. "This is toothless," he said finally, his voice dangerously quiet. He tossed the document back on the table. "It's a scare tactic. An expensive, well-drafted scare tactic designed to make you think you need a lawyer who charges eight hundred dollars an hour. Which, coincidentally, is probably what they paid theirs."

"Tell that to the part about my OnlyFans," Emma said, her voice muffled by the blanket.

Jasper, who had missed the initial explanation, looked confused. "Your what?"

Emma sat up slowly, pulling the blanket tight around her shoulders. She took a shaky breath. This was the moment she'd been dreading. The moment where her friends would see her differently.

"It's not—" she started, her voice rising defensively. "Look, it's weird, okay? I know it's weird. But I'm not doing anything illegal." The words started tumbling out faster, her careful 'chef' persona cracking. "I'm just cooking. In my own kitchen. Barefoot. And apparently that's a thing for some people, and those people pay me, and that money is the only reason I'm not back in Pennsylvania living in my parents' basement right now."

She braced herself for the reaction. For the judgment, the awkward silence, the careful distance.

"So what?" Olivia said immediately, her voice fierce. "It's your body, it's your kitchen. If some weirdo wants to pay you to watch you make pasta, that's their problem, not yours."

"Doesn't matter if you were naked," Jasper chimed in, surprisingly earnest. "It's still your business."

Elijah, who had been silent, finally spoke. He looked at Emma, and there was no judgment in his eyes. Only a quiet, surprising flicker of respect. "You found a market inefficiency and monetized it with minimal overhead costs," he said, his voice measured. "That's just good business." He paused, a dry smile crossing his face. "Though I have to say, 'Kinky Kitchen' is a significantly better brand name than 'E. Miller Financial Consulting.'"

"Are you saying you're jealous of Emma's foot fetish empire?" Jasper asked, delighted.

"I'm saying she found a more creative revenue stream than I did," Elijah corrected. "There's a difference."

Emma felt something loosen in her chest. They weren't looking at her with pity or disgust. They were just... her friends. Still.

"But how did they even find it?" Olivia asked, her practical mind already working the problem. "Your account is anonymous, right?"

Emma nodded. "Yeah, but my Instagram cooking videos are public. They're under my real name. If someone was really digging, really looking into my finances, my online presence..." She trailed off. "They must have hired someone. A private investigator maybe. To find leverage."

"That's so fucked up," Olivia said quietly.

Elijah's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and something flickered across his face—frustration, guilt, something complicated.

"I need to take this," he said, already standing. "Two minutes."

He stepped into Emma's tiny hallway, his back to the living room, voice low. The others couldn't hear the words, but they could hear the tone: patient, measured, the voice of someone who'd had this conversation a hundred times before.

When he came back, his jaw was tight.

"Everything okay?" Olivia asked.

"My mom," Elijah said shortly. "My sister's car broke down again. She needs money for the repair." He sat back down, rubbing his temples. "I told her I'd send it tomorrow."

"Elijah..." Emma started.

"It's fine," he said, and his voice made it clear the subject was closed. "Family stuff. It doesn't matter right now. What matters is figuring out what we do about this." He gestured at the legal document. "We can worry about my family drama later."

But Emma caught the way his shoulders stayed tense, the way his eyes returned to his phone for just a moment before he pocketed it. She knew that look. It was the look of someone carrying more weight than they let on.
