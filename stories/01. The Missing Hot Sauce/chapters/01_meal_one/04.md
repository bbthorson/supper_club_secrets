### Chapter Four - Stirring the Pot
"Drumroll, please," Elijah announced, shaking the cap with mock solemnity. He held it down to Emma. She reached in and pulled out a folded piece of paper. "Number two. I guess that's okay. I'm going to grab some water before my turn. Anybody want some?" Oliver held up his hand.

Elijah leaned over Emma to Noah. He pulled out a number and announced, "Five," with a disappointed look on his face.

Next up, Olivia. "Number three! I'll hold this whole thing together."

Oliver stood up and leaned over the coffee table. "I really don't want to do this." Elijah shook the hat. "Number one," Oliver sighed, slumping back onto the loveseat.

"Oh, God damnit," Noah immediately said.

"OH, GOD BLESS IT, BABY," Jasper stood up, his arms raised in victory.

"Anybody want to trade?" Noah asked the room at large. After a few seconds of silence, he accepted his fate and slouched in his folding chair.

Elijah slowly looked around the room, tapping his fingers together, and said in a deep, theatrical voice, "The order has been set. May the odds be ever in your favor."

Oliver stood up from the loveseat and composed himself.

Elijah interrupted, "Stand in the kitchen," and pointed. He stood up and turned off the living room lights to set the stage.

Oliver went to the kitchen, shoulders slumped. "You got this," yelled Olivia.

"I don't want to do this," started Oliver.

"But you have to," prodded Elijah, feeling the red wine start to take effect.

"Statistically," Oliver began, adjusting his glasses, "when a small business owner suddenly closes shop, the cause is almost always mundane. Financial trouble, a family issue."

"Boo!" Noah yelled.

"The historical precedent for dramatic kidnappings by business partners is, to be frank, negligible. But, if we must speculate," he sighed, "I suppose it's possible his online popularity led him to relocate to a state with a more favorable tax code."

"Except I already texted that shop owner and got the name of his hot sauce, and it's not for sale anywhere online," Olivia said, clearly tired of Oliver not cooperating.

"Fine," Oliver conceded. "He was moving, he took the website down, and his business partner, who was unaware of the move, caught wind of it and... kidnapped him. For money. Is that good enough?"

"Very intriguing, Oliver," Elijah said, relieving him of any more unwanted attention. "Who's next?"

Emma was already on her way to the kitchen. She hugged Oliver and whispered, "That was great," before lightly pushing him back to the living room.

"While Oliver has dreamt up a very believable fiction, it is still that!" Emma opened, adding "Fiction!" after a pause that was just too long, ruining the dramatic effect. "Unlike Oliver, I know what really happened to Hottie McHot Sauce."

"Wait, did you only care about this guy 'cause he's hot?" Noah interrupted.

"What? No. He's not hot. I mean, he's not not hot. He's... look, it's like Boaty McBoatface," Emma rebutted, losing the room's focus. "Hey! I know what happened." She paused. "It was Big Hot Sauce."

"Oh, shit! Big Hot Sauce in the house!" Jasper yelled in support, making finger guns. "Pew, pew, pew!"

"They saw Hank's artisanal, small-batch hot sauce as a rising threat," Emma declared, her voice rising with each word. "They knew his secret family recipe was too good, too authentic, too real. So they did what they always do—they crushed him. Bought him out, silenced him, maybe even... disappeared him." She paused dramatically, eyes wide. "Think about it. Have you seen Hank since last week? Exactly."

"Well, to be honest, literally none of us have ever seen Hank, so no," Oliver uncharacteristically interjected. He smirked and saw Olivia smiling at him out of the corner of his eye.

"You know what I mean, Ollie!" Emma said, resting her case. "Elijah knows I’m right. He’ll see the truth."

Olivia stood up and smoothed her skirt. "It looks like I’m next, and I’ll tell you, it’s quite simple." She was the picture of composure as her eyes slowly went across the room. "Oh, darling Emma, you're being so dramatic!" she said, channeling a bygone movie star. "It's far more likely Hank's been swept off his feet by some wealthy socialite. You know, the type who summers in the Hamptons and has a personal shopper at Bergdorf's. She probably whisked him away on her private jet to a secluded villa where they're sipping champagne and feeding each other caviar." She clasped her hands together, a dreamy smile on her face. "Honestly, I'd do the same if I had the chance!"

Jasper sprung from his chair, knocking over his wine glass. "Aliens!" he exclaimed. Emma rushed to get paper towels as Elijah picked up the glass, but the chaos did nothing to slow Jasper down.

"Hank's hot sauce was too hot! It was like a beacon!" he paced, gesticulating wildly. "Drawing in extraterrestrial beings from across the galaxy! They landed their spaceship in McCarren Park—you know, near where that one guy plays the banjo that sounds like Russian folk music? Coincidence? I think not!—and they snatched Hank right from his stall, and now they're probing him for his spicy secrets, probably because it's the perfect fuel for their warp drives!" He threw his hands up. "Or maybe it was the CIA. Or the Russians. Or maybe... maybe it was all of them working together!"

Noah leaned back, arms crossed. "You're all thinking too small," he said, his voice dripping with confidence. "This is obviously a state-actor play to leverage asymmetric market destabilization via a targeted supply chain disruption." He was met with blank stares. He sighed. "Look. It's the CIA. They're trying to destabilize the global pepper market. Step one: eliminate Hank. Step two: create a hot sauce shortage. Step three: profit." He smirked. "It's their master plan for world domination."

"They're all too good! Too good!" Elijah said through laughs as Jasper and Noah started arguing about lizard people. "I gotta be honest, I don't think I can pick! Let me get this straight. My options are: kidnapping, Big Hot Sauce conspiracy, alien abduction, and CIA destabilization of the pepper market." He looked around the room. "I'm starting to think the real mystery is how you all function in society."

A chorus of protests erupted. "Alright, alright," Elijah said, raising his hands in mock surrender. "You've all made compelling arguments. But I'm still not convinced. Maybe we need to do some actual investigating next week before I can make a final decision."
