### Chapter One - The Missing Hot Sauce

Emma's alarm went off at 6:30 AM on a Sunday, which was either very responsible or completely insane depending on how you looked at it. She slapped it off and lay there for a moment, staring at her ceiling and questioning her life choices.

Three weeks ago, she'd walked out of her sous chef position at Bistro Lavande, an aging French restaurant in the West Village where the recipes were older than she was and the head chef's primary management style was screaming in French. She'd finally snapped after he'd berated her—in front of the entire kitchen—for her attempt to update the coq au vin that hadn't changed since the 1980s.

"If you want to cook *your* food, open *your* restaurant," he'd spat.

So she'd untied her apron, handed it to him, and said, "Sure. Thanks for the advice."

It had felt amazing for approximately twelve hours. Then the panic set in.

Now, three weeks into freelance food writing and a vague plan to "build her brand" on Instagram, Emma was discovering that being your own boss mostly meant being broke and anxious. She had four article assignments due this month, a handful of private cooking lessons lined up, and a secret side hustle she couldn't tell anyone about. It was just barely enough to cover rent.

But today wasn't about survival. Today was about joy. She'd invited her closest friends over for dinner—a test run of some seasonal recipes she could photograph for her portfolio. No pressure, no paying customers, just cooking for people she loved.

First, though, she needed ingredients. And for that, she needed the McCarren Park farmers market.

Emma pulled on jeans and a sweater, grabbed her reusable bags, and headed out into the crisp October morning.

Williamsburg on a Sunday morning was quiet in that specific New York way—not actually quiet, but *relatively* quiet. The Saturday night crowd was still sleeping off their hangovers. The parents with strollers hadn't hit their stride yet. Even the brunch places were only just starting to set up tables.

Emma walked the familiar route to the market, her mind already spinning with possibilities. She'd been planning this menu for days, but something was missing. She needed a final element, something to tie it all together. That's when she'd thought of Hank.

Hank's hot sauce stall was always her first stop. Not just because his product was good—though it was—but because he made every bottle feel like a story. He'd greet customers with this theatrical pitch about his "secret family recipe," performing it like a carnival barker who genuinely loved his craft. Emma had always imagined using his hot sauce in a rich squash soup, the heat cutting through the sweetness, and telling his story when she served it.

Today was the perfect day to make that happen.

The market was already bustling when she arrived, rows of stalls overflowing with autumn's bounty—glossy squash in shades of orange and green, root vegetables still dusted with dirt, bundles of herbs tied with twine. The air smelled like apples and fresh bread and something smoky from the sausage vendor. Emma took a deep breath, feeling her anxiety ease slightly. This was her church.

She scanned the rows, looking for Hank's colorful setup. His stall was usually impossible to miss—bright red tablecloth, hand-painted signs, bottles arranged in precise pyramids.

But as she walked the entire perimeter of the market, Hank's stall was nowhere to be seen.

Emma frowned and approached one of the regular vendors, an older woman named Ruth who ran a preserve stand.

"Hey Ruth," Emma said. "Have you seen Hank this morning? The hot sauce guy?"

Ruth's expression shifted, something like concern crossing her face. "Oh honey, no. He was here last Saturday, but he seemed... off. Distracted. Kept checking his phone. Then Wednesday, we all got the email. He'd given up his stall."

"Gave it up?" Emma repeated. "Like, permanently?"

"That's what it sounded like. No explanation, no notice. Just done." Ruth shook her head. "Very strange for Hank. He's been here every weekend for three years. Never missed a day."

Emma thanked her and continued through the market. She pulled out her phone and found Hank's website—just a simple landing page with his story and a contact number. She hesitated, then dialed.

Straight to voicemail. The generic kind, not even Hank's voice.

She hung up, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. That wasn't like him. Hank loved talking about his hot sauce. He'd never miss a chance to tell his story.

By the time Emma headed home, her reusable bags filled with squash and apples and root vegetables, the mystery of the missing hot sauce vendor had taken up residence in her mind. It was easier to think about Hank's problems than her own, she realized. Easier to wonder about his disappearance than to calculate how many months of rent she had left in her savings account.

She pushed the thought away and focused on the afternoon ahead. Her friends would arrive in a few hours. She had cooking to do.

Whatever had happened to Hank, it would have to wait.
