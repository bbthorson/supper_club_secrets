### Chapter Six-B: The Empty Stall

*[New scene to be inserted between current Ch 6 and Ch 7]*

---

Saturday morning, Emma found herself back at the McCarren Park Greenmarket. She wasn't sure why. She had no shopping list, no recipe to test, no article deadline. She just... needed to see.

The market was in full swing, the usual Saturday crowd of young families with strollers, hungover millennials in sunglasses clutching coffees, and serious home cooks with their canvas bags and mental checklists. Emma walked the familiar perimeter, past the apple stand and the bread vendor and the woman who sold those overpriced lavender sachets that Olivia loved.

And then she was standing in front of the empty space.

Hank's spot. The prime corner location that caught morning light and foot traffic. It was just... gone. Not repurposed, not filled by another vendor. Just an empty square of concrete between the pickle guy and the honey lady, like a missing tooth in an otherwise healthy smile.

"Looking for Hank?"

Emma turned. The woman at the neighboring stall—Dorothy, according to her hand-painted sign—was watching her with knowing eyes. She was in her sixties, with weathered hands and a no-nonsense demeanor, surrounded by rows of golden honey jars.

"Yeah," Emma said. "I was hoping maybe... I don't know. That he'd be back."

Dorothy shook her head slowly. "Haven't seen him in two weeks. Not like him. Man never missed a market day in three years, rain or shine." She paused, arranging a row of honeycomb. "You're one of his regulars?"

"I am. Was." Emma stepped closer. "Did he seem okay to you? The last time you saw him?"

Dorothy's expression shifted, something guarded creeping in. "He seemed... scared. Kept looking over his shoulder like he was waiting for someone. And he gave me something." She reached under her table and pulled out a small, unlabeled bottle of deep red hot sauce. "Said his great-grandmother would've wanted her peppers shared. Told me to keep it. 'Just in case.'"

"In case of what?"

"He didn't say." Dorothy turned the bottle over in her weathered hands. "But that's not the kind of thing you say when you're going on vacation, is it?"

Emma stared at the bottle, at the handwritten label with its careful cursive: *Heritage Pepper Sauce - Small Batch - Hank*. Such a simple thing. Such a personal thing.

"Did he ever talk about his great-grandmother?" she asked quietly.

Dorothy smiled, the first warmth Emma had seen from her. "Oh, all the time. He'd tell anyone who'd listen. She came up from Virginia in the twenties, brought nothing but her clothes and those pepper seeds. Grew them in a tiny plot in Philly, passed them down through the family. Hank used to say she'd be proud to see her peppers feeding Brooklyn." The smile faded. "He really loved that story. Loved telling it."

Emma felt something tighten in her chest. She'd always admired Hank's theatrical sales pitch, but she'd assumed it was marketing—a clever hook to sell sauce. Standing here now, in the empty space where he used to perform that pitch every weekend, she realized it was more than that. It was heritage. It was identity. It was everything.

"If you see him," Dorothy said, "you tell him we miss him. The market's not the same."

"I will," Emma said. "I promise."

She walked home slowly, her mind churning. Whatever had happened to Hank, it wasn't just a business decision. Someone had scared him badly enough to give away his sauce, to abandon the market he loved, to disappear without a word.

The mystery had just gotten a lot more personal.
