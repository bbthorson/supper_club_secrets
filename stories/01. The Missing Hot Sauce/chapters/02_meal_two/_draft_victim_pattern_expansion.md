Wednesday afternoon, Emma's research was less a formal investigation and more a series of conversations. While sourcing ingredients for a freelance gig, she stopped by a cheese shop she frequented. The cheesemonger, a woman named Sofia with flour dusting her apron, had been a neighborhood fixture for twenty years.

"Hank? Yeah, he was a character," Sofia said while wrapping a wedge of aged cheddar in wax paper. "A real artist, that one. Passionate."

"Did he seem okay to you, the last time you saw him?" Emma asked, leaning against the counter.

Sofia paused, her knife hovering over a wheel of parmesan. "You know, it's funny you should ask. He came in here a couple of weeks ago, asking all sorts of questions about bottling and shelf life. Said he'd gotten a big offer, a chance to 'go legit.' I told him to be careful. These big companies, they don't care about the art. They just want the recipe." She shrugged. "Heard he took the deal. Can't blame him. We're all just trying to get by."

The word "deal" echoed in Emma's mind as she walked home. It wasn't aliens, and it wasn't a kidnapping. It was something far more common, and in its own way, far more sinister.

**Expanded version:**

Wednesday afternoon, Emma's research was less a formal investigation and more a series of conversations. While sourcing ingredients for a freelance gig, she stopped by a cheese shop she frequented. The cheesemonger, a woman named Sofia with flour dusting her apron, had been a neighborhood fixture for twenty years.

"Hank? Yeah, he was a character," Sofia said while wrapping a wedge of aged cheddar in wax paper. "A real artist, that one. Passionate."

"Did he seem okay to you, the last time you saw him?" Emma asked, leaning against the counter.

Sofia paused, her knife hovering over a wheel of parmesan. "You know, it's funny you should ask. He came in here a couple of weeks ago, asking all sorts of questions about bottling and shelf life. Said he'd gotten a big offer, a chance to 'go legit.' I told him to be careful." Her expression darkened. "These big companies, they don't care about the art. They just want the recipe."

"Did he say who made the offer?"

Sofia shook her head. "Wouldn't say. But I've seen this before." She set down her knife and leaned against the counter, lowering her voice. "You remember Paolo? The pickle guy?"

Emma frowned. "The one who was at the Smorgasburg?"

"That's him. Best bread-and-butters in Brooklyn. He was there for five years, built a real following. Then one day—poof. Gone. Same thing. 'Got an offer.' Next thing you know, his recipes are showing up in some corporate brand's 'artisanal line,' and Paolo's nowhere to be found." Sofia's voice was bitter. "I heard he moved back to Queens. Couldn't afford to fight it."

"Fight what?"

"The lawyers." Sofia shrugged, but her eyes were hard. "Paolo tried to keep selling on his own, after the deal fell through. Said they'd promised him a partnership, but the contract was garbage. When he walked away, they sued him. Said he'd 'misappropriated trade secrets.' His own grandmother's recipe, and they called it their trade secret. He couldn't afford the legal fees. Had to shut down."

Emma felt a chill run down her spine. "So you think... Hank?"

"I think if someone made Hank an offer he couldn't refuse, and then things went sideways..." Sofia picked up her knife again, returning to the parmesan with more force than necessary. "I think he might've learned what happens when you say no to people with more lawyers than morals."

"Do you know who's behind it? The company?"

Sofia shook her head. "Nobody ever says. That's the point. They use shell companies, numbered LLCs, all that corporate smoke. But there's a name that keeps coming up in the neighborhood. A restaurant guy who's been buying up properties on the waterfront." She looked at Emma directly. "I don't know if it's him, but I'd start there."

Emma thanked her and bought the cheddar she didn't need, her mind racing. This wasn't just about Hank anymore. There was a pattern here. Someone was systematically targeting small artisan vendors, making offers they couldn't refuse, and crushing anyone who tried to resist.

The word "deal" echoed in her mind as she walked home. It wasn't aliens, and it wasn't a kidnapping. It was something far more common, and in its own way, far more sinister. It was Brooklyn gentrification. It was corporate predation. It was a machine that chewed up people like Hank and Paolo and spat them out when their recipes had been extracted.

And her friends, with their wine and their wild theories, had stumbled right into the middle of it.
