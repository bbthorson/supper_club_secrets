# Chapter Writing Guide

## Chapter Structure

Each chapter should accomplish **1-2 story beats** (see Writing Guide). Length follows function:

| Chapter Type | Word Count | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Scene bridge | 800-1,200 | Quick transition, single beat |
| Standard | 2,000-2,500 | One or two beats, moderate pacing |
| Meal scene | 2,500-3,500 | Ensemble dialogue, multiple threads |

## Meal Chapters

Organize meal chapters within numbered folders:
- `01_meal_one/` - Setup chapters
- `02_meal_two/` - Investigation chapters  
- `03_meal_three/` - Crisis chapters
- `04_meal_four/` - Resolution chapters

Each meal folder should contain:
- `_overview.md` - Summary of key events for that meal
- `01.md`, `02.md`, etc. - Individual chapters

## Chapter Checklist

Before moving on from a chapter:

- [ ] Clear POV maintained throughout
- [ ] At least one beat accomplished
- [ ] Character voices consistent with Voice Guide
- [ ] Sensory details ground the scene (if meal scene: 2+ senses)
- [ ] Any clues planted are subtle but findable on reread
- [ ] Dialogue tags minimized, actions preferred
- [ ] Chapter ends with forward momentum

## Naming Convention

`##.md` where ## is the chapter number within that meal.

Example structure:
```
chapters/
├── 00_story_outline.md
├── 01_meal_one/
│   ├── _overview.md
│   ├── 01.md
│   ├── 02.md
│   └── 03.md
├── 02_meal_two/
│   ├── _overview.md
│   ├── 01.md
│   └── ...
```
